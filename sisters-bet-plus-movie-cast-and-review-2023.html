It is 1 minute and thirty-six minutes long.</p><p>The trailer begins with three masked females entering a house at night with a gun in their hands. The first question they ask the house owner is, where is the money?</p><p>The trailer then shows a top view of Los Angeles, California and immediately after that, we hear Diamond talking to E saying that her grandmother is sick.</p><p>After that, we are drawn to the hospital scene, where the three sisters are taking updates on their grandmother, to which Dr. Thomas replies in a low voice.</p><figure></figure><p>She continues by saying that after running a blood test on Pat, they have found signs of cancer, and have no health insurance.</p><p>Next, we see Diamond with E. It seems like she visited him for money but just like E, we viewers are shocked to see, her asking for some guns.</p><p>Similarly, Kevin tells the girls that there is a way to get Pat out of such a situation, an easy way to make money.</p><p>He tells her that they can possibly make about 100 million dollars.</p><p>It seems like the girls agree to get themselves involve in the process of earning fast cash.</p><p>The job might be to loot a person at gunpoint by entering their house at night.</p><p>Diamond is seen inside a car with Trae, possibly a member of the work the Sisters have indulged themselves into.</p><p>Trae threatens her for not picking up the call.
