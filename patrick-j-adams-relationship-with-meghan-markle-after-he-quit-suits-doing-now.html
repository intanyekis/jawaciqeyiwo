Throughout her seven-year tenure on Suits, Markle's character is perhaps best remembered for her passionate relationship with Mike Ross, portrayed by Patrick J. Adams.</p><p>Their on-screen romance was undeniably intense and <a href=#>they both cherish their off-screen closeness</a>. According to the Daily Mail, fans were moved to tears by their on-screen wedding in the series' seventh finale. Their chemistry was the series' main showrunner before Markle left in 2018, and Adams followed the next year.</p><h2 id=patrick-j-adams-paid-tribute-to-his-friendship-with-meghan-markle-on-his-instagram>Patrick J.

Despite the USA Network series concluding in 2019, Adams decided to acknowledge the Suits' renewed popularity in his Instagram bio, playfully alluding to Meghan Markle's journey after she departed from the show in season 7.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/A-scene-from-Suits-featuring-Patrick-J-Adams-and-Meghan-Markle-via-Suits-Wiki---Fandom.jpg><p>In his Instagram bio, he humorously quipped, "The guy from that show you're watching on that app because that girl married that prince." Adams also shared several photos of the cast on his Instagram, accompanied by the caption, "Let's get serious. Seriously. I miss my friends. Each and every one of them."</p><p>During their time working together, Adams and Markle developed a strong friendship. <a href=#>Adams and their former Suits co-stars even attended Markle's royal wedding</a> at Windsor Castle in London, England.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Patrick J.

"After our children were born, there were some texts sent and gifts sent, but I guess I'm a little scared. I think it's pure fear. I guess I'm scared about the idea of breaking through whatever walls exist to have that conversation."</p><p>He further explained, "Quite frankly, I think I'm intimidated. I have no doubt I could pick up the phone and call her at any moment, but I don't know what I would say."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Gabriel Macht And Jacinda Barrett's Relationship With Meghan Markle After Suits</a></span></p><p>Despite this, the two have exchanged a few texts, mainly centered on the subject of parenting. Adams was quick to clarify that his hesitation is primarily due to Markle's incredibly busy and imposing schedule, "We don't spend any time together, but that's not because of anything other than how completely enormous her life has become in so many ways," he explained via Today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=patrick-j-adams-expressed-his-support-for-meghan-markle-and-defended-her-against-media-scrutiny>Patrick J.

"Hello to the people and many bots debating all things Markle and including me in the conversation. I just want you to know a couple of things. 1. I don't read any of it. 2. Life is short. 3. There has to got to be better things for you to be doing.

That didn't feel right for him. It didn't feel right for where I was at in my life, either… It just felt like it was the way to go."</p><p>Adams told the publication that he intends to have a break and spend quality time at home with his wife, Pretty Little Liars alum Troian Bellisario, and their dogs. He emphasized the need to carefully consider his next career move, aiming for a project he could fully embrace and sustain over the long term.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adams and Bellisario became parents to their first child in October 2018, and their family expanded once again in May 2021, with the birth of their second daughter.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Troian Bellisario Secretly Ashamed To Have Been Part Of The 'Pretty Little Liars' Cast?</a></span></p><p>The couple also joined forces and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created a unique clothing collection inspired by their respective shows</a>, to raise funds for the Variety Boys & Girls Club's inaugural Photography Academy.
