It’s not fair to me or to the fans who want to see us both on the court. It’s also not good for his preparation. He should be here, getting used to the conditions and the atmosphere. He’s making a big mistake by hiding away.</p><p>Djokovic also suggested that Alcaraz was trying to avoid him and play mind games ahead of their highly anticipated clash.</p><p>Maybe he’s afraid of me, maybe he’s trying to psych me out, I don’t know. But it doesn’t matter. I’m focused on myself and on my game. I’m ready for him, wherever he is.</p><p>Alcaraz, who has been hailed as the next big thing in tennis after winning his second major title at the US Open, defended his decision to skip the official training session, saying that it was part of his strategy and routine. Alcaraz said in a phone interview from his undisclosed location</p><p>I respect Djokovic a lot, but I have my own way of doing things. I don’t need to train with him or in front of him. I know what I have to do to beat him. I have my own team and my own plan. I’m not hiding from anyone. I’m just following my own path.</p><p>Alcaraz also dismissed Djokovic’s comments as “noise” and said that he was confident of repeating his Wimbledon feat and denying Djokovic his historic quest. Alcaraz said</p><p>I don’t care what he says or thinks. He can say whatever he wants, but it won’t affect me or my game. I’m ready for him, too. I’ve beaten him before and I can beat him again. I’m not afraid of him or anyone else.</p><p>The final between Djokovic and Alcaraz is expected to be a thrilling and tense affair, as both players have a lot at stake. Djokovic is aiming to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win all four majors in a single year, while Alcaraz is looking to cement his status as the new king of tennis and the leader of the next generation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Height_and_Weight></span><strong>Height and Weight</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jelena Djokovic is&nbsp;5 feet 9 inches (175 cm)&nbsp;tall and weighs around&nbsp;128 lbs (58 kg).
