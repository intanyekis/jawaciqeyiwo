She wears whatever she wants and however she feels like. She has no restraint when it comes to making epic statements with her fashion choice. Although sometimes her outfits bring headaches to the public, her fearless attitude towards style has stayed the same for years. Here is the emphasis on how her style has evolved over the last 12 years:</p><p>Miley Cyrus became a household name when she took on the role of Hannah Montana—the teen pop sensation on stage, but just an ordinary high school girl named Miley Ray Stewart off-stage. Disney’s successful series Hannah Montana made its debut in 2006 and the last episode aired in January 2011. There is also a Hannah Montana: The Movie&nbsp;that released in 2009. As with many Disney stars, <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> grew up with the TV series, so her style was highly influenced by her character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hannah Montana first&nbsp;rocked the typical Disney child star fashion of the early 2000s, which consisted of a lot of shimmery sequined tunics, sequinned long sleeves, cropped jackets, short leggings to show off statement boots or colorful leggings, or jeans paired with eye-catching sneakers. More laid-back ensembles of the tween pop star include colorful tops and cropped jackets. Hannah Montana's looks had the breeze of the country as well- with cowboy boots and hats.</p><p>In 2008,&nbsp;Cyrus made her first debut as herself on her Best of Both Worlds Tour. Opposite to the glamorous Hannah Montana, Miley was the stylish, spunky girl next door with a colorful bomber jacket and top, plaid skirts and athletic tennis socks. Miley later-on wore outfits that made statements like her alter-ego: pure gold trench, gold touch-ups on her outfits and accessories.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>MILEY CYRUS TAKES BACK APOLOGY FOR CONTROVERSIAL VANITY FAIR COVER</a></strong></p><p>Both Hannah and Miley got familiar with tutu and frilly skirts, colorful dresses and heavily-embellished jackets in Hannah Montana: The Movie and from season 3 of the Disney’s series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then came the crossover era. Cyrus started to dress like a global phenomenon singer instead of just another TV star in 2009. In a red sleeveless satin gown, she slayed the song Party in the USA at the Kids Inaugural: We Are The Future Concert for former President Obama's inauguration festivities. From then, her style included many monochromatic floor-length gowns that are modest, elegant but far from simple and boring. This choice of outfit significantly helped she made an identity as Miley Cyrus- the singer.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>MILEY CYRUS DROPS BIG MONEY ON MASSIVE TENNESEE PROPERTY</a></strong></p><p>Her first liberating look was when she performed her song Liberty Walk on MTV Europe Music Awards live show, wearing a long sleeve silk leotard and heeled combat boots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The edgy Miley started to officially come out in 2012, after the Hannah Montana series has officially ended. She cut her hair and died it to platinum colors. Audiences got used to a Miley in spiked out oversized leather jackets whith cropped, leather skinny pants, sky-high heeled ankle boots, glittering outfits, notorious and controversial bodysuits as well as two-piece performing outfits. One definitely cannot forget Miley’s shocking performance with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. Although she still dressed modestly in more formal occasions, her edgy side still shown.</p><p>The Bangerz tour was probably Miley’s most controversial tour in her entire career. Not only because of the stage decorations Miley's funky, out-of-the-box outfits and her rebellious performances created a turmoil. She also brought the multi-color theme to awards show such as the VMAs. She has dressed as the LGBT flag, a sun,&nbsp;and many unimaginable fashion pieces.</p><p>Then, she started to calm down. During the Miley & Maya Medley sketch in 2016, Miley wore a black pantsuit with a white statement flower and a glittering black top hat. This Victorian vibe look was the tamest ensemble the public has seen Miley wore in years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer/songwriter continued to bring the vibe of the 18th century to The Voice’s stage as she delivered an over-the-top performance with fellow judges (Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Alicia Keys) in her red coat outfit.</p><p>A tamer version of Smiley Miley is back in town when she starts pulling out her old blue jeans, more modest but still funky T-shirts. As she grows her hair long again, the next-door country girl also made her return. The "Malibu" singer opts for a more bohemian and laid-back looks. Shorts, off-the-shoulder blouses, fedora and floppy hats also came back with her. Her leotards are now more classic and modest too. Aside from the performing outfits,&nbsp;Cyrus also graced the red carpet with princess-like gowns. She also wore sleek gowns that highly highlight her body curves. Most recently, Miley wore vegan cut-out gown by designer Stella McCartney and a custom design vegan heels by Mink. She also recently released cruelty-free shoes and an athleisure line with Converse.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>CHECK OUT MILEY CYRUS' CONVERSE LINE</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s been quite a roller-coaster for Miley’s fashion journey.
