The Nightmare on Elm Street movies are now Halloween <a href=#>classics</a> that fans watch every year and still love Freddy even though he's been around a long time. As soon as you see his long, razored hand with his red and green striped sweater, you know who he is. His gloved hand with razors is the most iconic part of his character because it's what he uses to kill the children (now teenagers) whose parents burned him alive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>All Seven Original Freddy Krueger Films Will Stream on HBO Max</a></span></p><p>He gets his revenge in the most horrific way possible—by slashing them in their sleep. They can't escape it because they can't live without sleep and they can't sleep without being confronted by Freddy. That's what makes his character so much scarier than others. Let's take a look at all of the times he appeared somewhere other than the Nightmare on Elm Street movies.</p><h2 id=lsquo-nightmare-on-elm-street-rsquo-game><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>‘Nightmare On Elm Street’ (Game)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This isn’t the original ANightmare on Elm Street that kept us up at night. This is the less scary video game version of Freddy. In 1989, Nintendo decided to make a game based on him and it was the first time he appeared somewhere other than the Nightmare on Elm Street movies (even though it didn’t look like him that much). According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ScreenRant</a>, “He’s been neutered beyond belief. Gone is the Freddy who rips off his own face and eviscerates teenagers. Instead, we get a Freddy who turns into a giant hand or head on a ball and can only walk back and forth across the screen. He’s also the only interpretation of the character to get his butt kicked by a dude wearing spandex.”</p><h2 id=lsquo-mortal-kombat-9-rsquo><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>‘Mortal Kombat 9’</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More than two decades after Nintendo created the Nightmare on Elm Street game, Freddy was featured in another video game called Mortal Kombat 9. It seems like the video game creators based his character off of the 2010 version of ANightmare on Elm Street and fans were disappointed in their decision. “His fighting style and moves were decent, but he had some of the tamest and lamest fatalities in the entire game. Seriously, this was a game with people getting ripped in half and having the flesh burned off of their skin while they hung by their neck,” according to ScreenRant. Even though Freddy didn’t look like his original version in the game, fans still liked to play it since they could play with other horror characters along with him.</p><h2 id=lsquo-freddy-39-s-nightmares-rsquo><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>‘Freddy's Nightmares’</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Freddy’s Nightmares is a TV show that’s based on the first few ANightmare on Elm Street movies. Freddy isn’t in every episode, but he still gets his revenge. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fandom</a>, “Robert Englund continued his role as Freddy Krueger on October 9, 1988 in the television anthology series entitled Freddy's Nightmares. The show was hosted by Freddy Krueger, who did not take direct part in most of the episodes, but he did show up occasionally to influence the plot of particular episodes… Season two's ‘It's My Party and You'll Die If I Want You To’ featured Freddy attacking a high school prom date who stood him up twenty years earlier.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About The Bathtub Scene In A Nightmare On Elm Street</a></span></p><h2 id=lsquo-jason-goes-to-hell-the-final-friday-rsquo><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>‘Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday’</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Freddy made a very short appearance in the ninth installment of the Friday the 13th series, Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday. “After Jason Voorhees is killed by some extremely lucky teenagers, his body is dragged down to hell by what are assumed to be demons. At the very end of the film, a dog digs up Jason’s iconic hockey mask. As the camera zooms in, the gloved hand of Freddy bursts through the ground. His sinister laughter is heard as he drags the mask down into the fiery depths,” according to ScreenRant. He only appears for a few seconds, but it still counts. Those last few seconds of the movie gave horror fans hope that there would be a movie with Freddy and Jason. And they were right.</p><h2 id=lsquo-freddy-vs-jason-rsquo><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>‘Freddy Vs. Jason’</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Freddy showed up in the Friday the 13th franchise eight years later after he dragged Jason’s mask down into the ground. But this time, he had a huge part of the movie. According to IMDb, the movie is about “Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees return to terrorize the teenagers of Elm Street. Only this time, they're out to get each other, too.” The teenagers start to forget Freddy in the movie and that makes him weak, so he brings Jason back to try to get them to remember him. That ends up backfiring though and they end up fighting each other. Fans love seeing both horror characters in one movie and might be one of the most popular movies in the franchise.</p><h2 id=lsquo-freddy-vs-jason-vs-ash-rsquo><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>‘Freddy Vs. Jason Vs. Ash’</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Freddy goes against even more horror characters in this one. After Freddy Vs. Jason came out, fans wanted to see them face off against Ash Williams from Evil Dead and they got that with the comic book, Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash. According to ScreenRant, “Although a movie version never came to be for various reasons, the story that fans begged for years finally came to fruition in 2007 when Wildstorm and Dynamite Comics published Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash. The plot involves Freddy Krueger trying to steal the Necronomicon in order to gain power in the real world. Meanwhile, Jason Voorhees tries to get revenge for their previous encounter, and Ash Williams is transferred to the Crystal Lake S-Mart.”</p><h2 id=lsquo-rick-and-morty-rsquo><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>‘Rick And Morty’</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s not exactly Freddy who appears in the TV show, Rick and Morty, but the character is a knock off of him. He appears as Scary Terry in one of its episodes and his look is still basically the same, but fits the style of the TV show. According to ScreenRant, “This slasher appears in the second episode of the show’s first season, 'The Lawnmower Dog'. As the titular characters travel through layer after layer of the dream world (a la Inception) they encounter Scary Terry, a dream-hopping slasher who wears a fedora and striped sweater… Although he appears terrifying at first, Rick and Morty discover that he’s really just an average family man who is completely insecure about his scariness.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>18 Things About Rick And Morty That Make No Sense</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lsquo-family-guy-rsquo><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>‘Family Guy’</span></h2><p>Family Guy is another adult cartoon Freddy has appeared in. He actually appears as himself in this show. “In ‘The Splendid Source,’ Glenn Quagmire goes into the dreamworld and pays Krueger to tell Peter a dirty joke in his dreams so he can poop in his bed. Peter wakes up and realizes when one defecates in their dreams, they defecate in reality,” according to Fandom. Family Guy is known for making fun of classic movies and this was their way of doing it with ANightmare on Elm Street—instead of dying from your dreams, you poop from your dreams.</p><h2 id=lsquo-the-simpsons-rsquo><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>‘The Simpsons’</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Freddy also makes an appearance in The Simpsons, but like Rick and Morty, he appears as a different character. According to Fandom, the episode, ‘Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace,’ is about “Bart has a nightmare that Groundskeeper Willie is out to kill him. He is slashed with a rake, and the scratches are still on his body after he wakes up. Many other students at Springfield Elementary School also say they were terrorized by Willie in their nightmares.” Freddy has made other appearances in The Simpsons, but that’s the biggest one he had on the show and maybe we’ll see more of him on the show in the future.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Is ‘A Nightmare On Elm Street’ Actually Based On A True Story?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irnqnvsSdm7Jlm6fCprPEq2SaqKCarrOtzZycZqelqcCqsMRmq6GdXaO2qLTTppirnV2ku26xy6ZkrKyimrK1ecyoraKdo2KzornIpbBmn6WufA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fevery-freddy-krueger-appearance-outside-the-nightmare-on-elm-street-movies-family-guy.html&text=Every%20Freddy%20Krueger%20Appearance%20Outside%20The%20Nightmare%20On%20Elm%20Street%20Movies&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fevery-freddy-krueger-appearance-outside-the-nightmare-on-elm-street-movies-family-guy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevery-freddy-krueger-appearance-outside-the-nightmare-on-elm-street-movies-family-guy.html&title=Every%20Freddy%20Krueger%20Appearance%20Outside%20The%20Nightmare%20On%20Elm%20Street%20Movies" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fevery-freddy-krueger-appearance-outside-the-nightmare-on-elm-street-movies-family-guy.html&title=Every%20Freddy%20Krueger%20Appearance%20Outside%20The%20Nightmare%20On%20Elm%20Street%20Movies" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fevery-freddy-krueger-appearance-outside-the-nightmare-on-elm-street-movies-family-guy.html&title=Every%20Freddy%20Krueger%20Appearance%20Outside%20The%20Nightmare%20On%20Elm%20Street%20Movies" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevery-freddy-krueger-appearance-outside-the-nightmare-on-elm-street-movies-family-guy.html&description=Every%20Freddy%20Krueger%20Appearance%20Outside%20The%20Nightmare%20On%20Elm%20Street%20Movies" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-cook-baby-marrow.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Cook Baby Marrow">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./david-deluise-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David DeLuise Biography  Where Is The Actor Now?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
