He was an innovative rock star who would earn the title, "King of Rock and Roll." His songs are very memorable, including "Heartbreak Hotel," "Jailhouse Rock", and "Love Me Tender."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite his undeniable charisma, not to mention his good looks, fame, wealth, and talent, everything was not perfect for Elvis. There were moments in his life that were dark and unsettling. Even so, we cannot deny that Elvis' life was one of the most interesting in music history.</p><p>To this day, there are still new discoveries about the "King of Rock and Roll". There are things that people just do not know. As the years go by, Elvis fans will always have a legacy to look back on.</p><p>Here are fifteen things about Elvis Presley that have come to light.</p><h2 id=the-secret-to-shiny-hair><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>The Secret To Shiny Hair</span></h2><p>Elvis was one of the most captivating men in the mid-20th century. One of his trademark features was his hair, which was known for its deep black sheen. As for how he managed to keep it slick and shiny, it wasn't always hair gel. He once used black shoe polish <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">instead</a>!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-loved-at-first><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Not Loved At First</span></h2><p>When he got famous, Elvis received a lot of attention from girls. They were crushing hard on him...and boys were wanting to be like him. Maybe you thought it was like this for him from the start? It really wasn't.</p><p>During his time at school, he was a loner. Whenever he would bring his guitar to play music, kids would pick on him.</p><h2 id=who-wrote-the-songs-then><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Who Wrote The Songs Then?</span></h2><p>Elvis is, by definition, a musical genius, but that is because of his powerful and memorable vocals and the way he brought emotion into the songs he sang. What might be a surprise to people is that he did not write his songs at all.</p><p>A couple of songwriters who worked with Elvis were&nbsp;Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Those two guys were responsible for songs such as "Hound Dog" and "King Creole."</p><h2 id=even-kings-get-rejected><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Even Kings Get Rejected</span></h2><p>Elvis had a passion for music and he knew it. Even though he was shy at first, he loved singing and playing the guitar. When he was nineteen, Elvis auditioned for a gospel quartet called Songfellows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rejected</a> because the group thought he couldn't sing in harmony. Despite this, he continued to pursue his dreams.</p><h2 id=too-shy-to-sing><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Too Shy To Sing</span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Elvis was a rather shy kid growing up. When he was about twelve, he had the opportunity to sing at a local station during one of the station's shows. Due to his extreme shyness, Elvis <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">declined</a> the offer.</p><p>It definitely took a lot of courage for him to be able to sing publicly. We're all glad he did.</p><h2 id=another-elvis><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Another Elvis?</span></h2><p>One of the traumatic events in Elvis' life was the fact that he was a twin.&nbsp;Jesse Garon Presley was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">born</a> about thirty-five minutes before Elvis but was unfortunately stillborn.</p><p>It would have made Elvis' childhood less lonely, and we cannot help but imagine what it would be like to have another Elvis in this world.</p><h2 id=almost-arrested-for-a-dance><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Almost Arrested For A Dance</span></h2><p>When Elvis danced, it was seen as a bit too much for TV executives. It made the girls go crazy and his dance moves earned him the name, Elvis the Pelvis. In 1956, a juvenile court judge named&nbsp;Marion Gooding attended a concert in Florida.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once Elvis started using his suggestive dance moves, Marion <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">threatened</a> to arrest him.</p><h2 id=entering-the-military><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Entering The Military</span></h2><p>At the height of his fame, Elvis took a small break to enroll in the military for two years. He was in the United States Army and held the rank of Sergeant. Unfortunately, tragedy struck when he enlisted. His mother passed away as he was about to be stationed at a base in Germany.</p><h2 id=found-the-love-of-his-life><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Found The Love Of His Life</span></h2><p>There were some good things about the singing star's life while he was stationed in West Germany. It was there that he met Priscilla&nbsp;Beaulieu. Once they met, they were pretty much inseparable.</p><p>Even though it would be two years of no music from Elvis, his time in Germany would be one of the most important phases in his life.</p><h2 id=if-the-relationship-happened-today><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>If The Relationship Happened Today...</span></h2><p>The love story of Elvis and Priscilla is legendary. Back then, their relationship would have been no problem. However, if they were to be together today, it would actually be illegal because she was so young when they started seeing each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They did get married when Priscilla turned twenty-one. You probably know Priscilla Beaulieu as Priscilla Presley.</p><h2 id=was-hoping-for-a-bike><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Was Hoping For A Bike</span></h2><p>Before video games and computers were a thing, boys like Elvis wanted more practical gifts for their birthdays. For his eleventh birthday, he either wanted a rifle or a bike.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instead</a>, he got a guitar.</p><p>Elvis has been photographed plenty of times with motorbikes, so he did eventually get his childhood wish.</p><h2 id=sadly-not-lasting-long><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Sadly Not Lasting Long</span></h2><p>While the marriage between Elvis and Priscilla resulted in the birth of their daughter, Lisa Marie, it did not last. Sure, many girls were envious of Priscilla and rejoiced in their separation, but she was trying to find herself.</p><p>She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>, "I left because... I needed to find out what the world was like." I didn't really know who I was."</p><p>Despite divorcing, they still loved and supported each other until Elvis' untimely passing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eradicating-an-awful-epidemic><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Eradicating An Awful Epidemic</span></h2><p>Celebrity endorsement was huge back in the day. If there was a movie star advertising for a drink or product, fans would buy the living heck out of that drink or product. Polio was a concerning disease and a cure was discovered, but not enough people were taking the vaccine.</p><p>In comes Elvis, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posed</a> for a photo while taking the vaccine. Because of his contribution, polio diagnoses decreased drastically.</p><h2 id=dressing-up-to-give-autographs><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Dressing Up To Give Autographs</span></h2><p>Elvis was a bad boy in the mid-20th century and the term, 'bad boy', may just be an understatement. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">received</a>&nbsp;a police badge from President Richard Nixon and his mischevious side came out.</p><p>Sometimes, he would dress up as a police officer and pull over women, only to give them autographs.</p><h2 id=a-biopic-coming-soon><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>A Biopic Coming Soon</span></h2><p>After waiting for so long after Elvis' passing, a biopic depicting the life of the king will be released in 2021. Austin Butler of Zoey 101 and Switched at Birth fame will play the iconic legend, with Tom Hanks costarring as Colonel Tom Parker and Olivia DeLonge as Priscilla.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Knew?
