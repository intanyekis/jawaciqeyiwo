She came on media highlight because of her love interest; Mike.</p><p>What she is actually doing nowadays? How is her marital life with husband; Mike?

Know about her Personal life, Kids<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lakiha Spicer is a married woman. She tied the knot to her boyfriend husband, <strong>Mike Tyson</strong> on June 6, 2009,&nbsp;at the La Bella Wedding Chapel at the Las Vegas Hilton.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Aceshowbiz-205x300.jpg><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;Aceshowbiz</strong></p><p>Lakhia and her spouse, Mike share two kids together, a daughter, <strong>Milan Tyson</strong>, and a son, <strong>Morocco Tyson</strong>.</p><p><strong>You May Like:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Australian Boxer Joel Brunker Wiki: Married Life</strong></a></p><p>Coming back to their initial phase of love, the duo first met in a boxing event when Lakhia was just 18 years old. And when she turned 23, she started dating with Mike in New York.</p><p>Furthermore, their relationship turned to a serious love in 2008.&nbsp;When one week before entering federal prison to serve a six-month sentence for money fraud and conspiracy, Lakiha found that she was pregnant with Mike’s kid.</p><p>Following her&nbsp;release from Prison, she gave birth to a daughter; <strong>Milan</strong> in December 2008. After that, she met Mike, who was then battling drug addiction at that time.</p><p>As a matter of fact, Mike denied continuing his love life with Lakiha at first. But due to the loving and caring nature of Lakhia, Mike&nbsp;decided to change his ways and commit to her. As a result, they turned their affair into a marital relationship.</p><p>Coming to their marital life, the loving duo again became parents of a son&nbsp;<strong>Morocco Elijah Tyson</strong> on January 25, 2011.</p><p>There are no more divorce issues and affair issues regarding Mike and his wife; Lakisha. However, that does not justify the past. Previously, Mike&nbsp;Tyson married twice with&nbsp;<strong>Robin Givens</strong> and <strong>Monica Turner.</strong></p><p>The couple still shares a deep love together which they proved during the French Open. Both of them attended the 2018 French Open at Ronald Garros in Paris where Spicer was seen wiping the sweat of her husband with her tender touch. This shows that the couple is having a great relationship.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Controversies_Scandals></span><strong>Controversies & Scandals</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In September 2004, Lakiha Spicer, along with her parents were charged with conducting and participating in a racketeering enterprise. In fact, they did so to obtain money and property through schemes involving extortion and bribery.</p><p>Following the trial, Lakiha was sentenced to house arrest and four years probation, while her father served jail term till 2013 and her mother sentenced to over a year in prison.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is An Australian Professional Boxer Danny Green Married To?</a></strong></p><p><span>In&nbsp;</span>2008<span>, she got herself in federal prison to serve a six-month term due to the conviction of fraud and conspiracy over receiving </span><strong>$71,000</strong><span> from her father’s company.</span></p><p>After that in 2013, Lakiha filed a lawsuit after her statement that she was receiving emails from an unidentified person. The person threatened the safety of her and her family with false accusations.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lakiha_Spicer%E2%80%99s_Net_Worth_How_Much_Wealth_Does_She_Earn></span>Lakiha Spicer’s Net Worth: How Much Wealth Does She Earn?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If it had not been for her husband, Mike Tyson, Lakiha Spicer would not have become such a popular name. We can easily guess that Tyson holds a huge net worth, but what is the net worth of Tyson’s wife Lakiha Spicer?</p><p>Unfortunately, looking for any information about Spicer’s net worth on the internet is a worthless pursuit. We can find nothing related to her net worth. In contrast, the case is different with her husband, Tyson. So, what is the exact figure of Mike Tyson’s net worth?</p><p>To be exact, Mike has an estimated net worth of <strong>$3&nbsp;million</strong>. However, that’s not all he earned, he actually earned and spent&nbsp;<strong>$7 million&nbsp;</strong>when he was active in his boxing profession.</p><p class="title style-scope ytd-video-primary-info-renderer"><strong>Youtube; Mike Tyson – All 6 losses by a KNOCKOUT</strong></p><p></p><p>In addition to that, Mike sold his old house at <strong>$1.3 million </strong>and further he bought a new house at around <strong>$2.5 million</strong>.&nbsp;He also spent <strong>$4.5 million</strong> of his fortune&nbsp;on cars.</p><p>Some of Mike’s car collection;</p><ul class=i8Z77e><li class=TrT0Xe>14 Ferrari 456 GT Spyder=&nbsp;<strong>$90,452 to $399,164.</strong></li><li class=TrT0Xe>15 1995 Ferrari F50= around <strong>$524,400</strong></li><li class=TrT0Xe>17 Rolls-Royce Corniche= more than<strong> $105,280</strong></li></ul><p>Multiple sources agree that Mike earned&nbsp;<strong>$400 million&nbsp;</strong>as a boxer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lakiha_Spicer_Wiki-Bio></span>Lakiha&nbsp;Spicer Wiki-Bio<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lakiha&nbsp;Spicer was born in born&nbsp;in Philadelphia in 1977,&nbsp;to her parents;<strong> Shamsud-din Ali</strong> and <strong>Faridah Ali.</strong>&nbsp;She grew up with her brother named <strong>Azheem Spicer</strong> who is three years’ older than her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/thefamous-people-300x250.jpg><p><strong>Source: The Famous People</strong></p><p>Lakiha Spicer attended a local school of her hometown.
