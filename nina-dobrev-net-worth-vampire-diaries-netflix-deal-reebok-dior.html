Both shows have contributed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her growing $11 million net worth</a>, however, she's made her millions elsewhere, too. In addition to being an ambassador for both Reebok and Christian Dior, Nina Dobrev has appeared in international commercials, mainly Lux hair care products in Japan. Nina has also appeared in two high-grossing films, XxX alongside Vin Diesel, and Perks Of Being A Wallflower. Luckily for Nina, her acting career is steadily on the rise after scoring a deal with Netflix appearing in the most recent rom-com release, Love Hard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=astute-career-choices-from-a-young-age><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Astute Career Choices From A Young Age</span></h2><p>As an actress, Nina Dobrev knew that she had to make some smart career moves in order to get rich and famous.
