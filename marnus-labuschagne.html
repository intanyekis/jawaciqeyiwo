In the Australian domestic circuit, he has played for Queensland (2014-15–Present) across all 3 formats. He has also turned out for Brisbane Heat (2016-17–Present) in the BBL (Big Bash League). A rare occurrence in modern cricket, Marnus has also played domestic cricket outside of his home country representing Glamorgan County Cricket Club (2019–Present) in England. In January 2020, he had won the ‘Emerging Cricketer of the Year’ award at the annual ICC (International Cricket Council) Awards. The following month, he had won the ‘Test Player of the Year’ award at the annual CA (Cricket Australia) Awards. In April that year, he had been named as one of the 5 ‘Cricketers of the Year’ by the Wisden Cricketers’ Almanack, a cricket reference book that is published annually and is often referred to as the ‘Bible of Cricket’.</p><h3>Born Name</h3><p>Marnus Labuschagne</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>Loose-Bus-Change, The Mighty LaBoosh</p><figure id=attachment_362363 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-362363 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Marnus Labuschagne as seen in an Instagram Post in December 2020 (Marnus Labuschagne / Instagram)</figure><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Cancer</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>Klerksdorp, North West Province, South Africa</p><h3>Residence</h3><p>Brisbane, Queensland, Australia</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p></p><h3>Education</h3><p>Marnus had attended the <strong>Brisbane State High School</strong>, a partially selective, co-educational, state secondary school in South Brisbane.</p><h3>Occupation</h3><p>Professional Cricketer</p><figure id=attachment_362361 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-362361 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Marnus Labuschagne as seen in an Instagram Post in April 2020 (Marnus Labuschagne / Instagram)</figure><h3>Family</h3><ul><li><strong>Father</strong> – Andre Labuschagne (Miner)</li><li><strong>Mother </strong>– Alta Labuschagne</li><li><strong>Siblings</strong> – Pieter Labuschagne (Brother) (Professional Rugby Player), Ame Labuschagne (Sister)</li></ul><h3>Batting</h3><p>Right-Handed</p><h3>Bowling</h3><p>Right-Arm Leg Break</p><h3>Role</h3><p>Batting All-Rounder</p><h3>Jersey Number</h3><ul><li>33 – Test Match, One Day International (ODI)</li><li>9 – Queensland / Queensland Bulls (Australian Domestic Cricket)</li><li>33, 9 – Brisbane Heat (BBL)</li><li>99 – Glamorgan County Cricket Club (English Domestic Cricket)</li></ul><h3>Build</h3><p>Athletic</p><h3>Height</h3><p>5 ft 11 in or 180.5 cm</p><h3>Weight</h3><p>75 kg or 165.5 lbs</p><h3>Girlfriend / Spouse</h3><p>Marnus has dated –</p><li><strong>Rebekah Labuschagne</strong> (2017-Present) – Marnus had married his long-term girlfriend Rebekah in May 2017.</li><figure id=attachment_362364 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-362364 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Marnus Labuschagne and Rebekah Labuschagne, as seen in December 2021 (Marnus Labuschagne / Instagram)</figure><h3>Race / Ethnicity</h3><p>White</p><p>He is of Afrikaner descent.</p><h3>Hair Color</h3><p>Light Brown</p><h3>Eye Color</h3><p>Green</p><h3>Sexual Orientation</h3><p>Straight</p><h3>Distinctive Features</h3><ul><li>Toned physique</li><li>Short-cropped, side-parted hair</li><li>Cheerful smile</li><li>Clean-shaven look</li></ul><h3>Religion</h3><p>Christianity</p><h3>Brand Endorsements</h3><p>Marnus has been sponsored by –</p><ul><li>Nike, Inc.</li><li>Kookaburra Cricket AUS/NZ</li><li>Weet-Bix</li></ul><figure id=attachment_362362 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-362362 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Marnus Labuschagne as seen in an Instagram Post in August 2021 (Marnus Labuschagne / Instagram)</figure><h3>Marnus Labuschagne Facts</h3><li>Born in Klerksdorp, South Africa, Marnus and his family had emigrated to Australia in 2004 after his father had obtained some work in the mining industry there.</li><li>In November 2010, he had worked as a Hot Spot infrared camera operator at the Brisbane Cricket Ground during the 2010–11 Ashes test series.</li><li>His breakthrough as a cricketer came when he had scored 273 runs at an average of 45 in the 2016–17 Matador BBQs One-Day Cup (the premier domestic one-day cricket competition in Australia). He had been named the ‘Player of the Tournament’. He was also the 2nd leading run-scorer in the 2017-18 season of the Sheffield Shield (the premier domestic first-class cricket competition in Australia), scoring 795 runs at an average of 39.75 with 2 centuries.</li><li>In September 2017, during a domestic one-day match, he became the first fielder to be penalized under a new law that had been introduced to stop fielders from deceiving batsmen. He had failed to stop a ball while fielding but had feigned throwing it to the wicket-keeper after which 5 runs from his team’s score had been deducted.</li><li>During the 2019 English domestic season, for Glamorgan County Cricket Club, he had scored 1,114 runs in his first County Championship season, including 3 centuries in his first 4 first-class matches. He was the 2nd-highest scorer in the second division of the County Championship, despite playing just 10 matches. He had also captured 19 wickets that season.</li><li>Although renowned as one of the best young batsmen to arrive on the international scene in the late 2010s, his early test matches were marked by stronger bowling performances. He had scalped 2 wickets on his test match debut and 5 in the next match. His batting took precedence thereafter and he had picked just 5 more wickets in his next 17 test matches.</li><li>On August 18, 2019, he had become the first cricketer in history to be used as a concussion substitute in a test match. He had replaced <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Steve Smith</a> who had been hit by a bouncer on the previous day and had suffered a delayed concussion. Marnus had scored 59 runs on the last day of that match, the highest in the Australian 2nd innings.</li><li>Marnus was then selected for the next test match, the 3rd of the series, in Steve’s absence. He had top-scored for Australia in both innings of that match and courtesy of England’s lowly total of 67 runs in their first innings, he had become just the 5th batsman in history to make 2 scores in a test match that were both higher than the total scored by the opposing team in one of their innings.</li><li>Marnus was the leading run-scorer in Test matches in 2019 after which he had risen to 4th place in the ICC Player Rankings (test match format), a phenomenal rise of 106 places within a year.</li><li>By mid-December 2021, he had risen to the 2nd spot in those rankings. Around the same time, after he had scored 103 runs in the first innings of the 2nd match of the 2021-22 Ashes test series, his batting average had ballooned to 62.48. This had made him the batsman with the 2nd-highest test match batting average in history, only behind the legendary <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Sir Donald Bradman</a> who had recorded a mind-boggling average of 99.94 in 52 test matches.</li><li>At the end of the aforementioned match, he had become the number one ranked batter in the world for the first time, in the test match format, in the ICC Rankings.</li><li>In June 2023, Marnus claimed an illegal catch on Day 4 of the first Ashes (which is played against England) 2023 Test against England’s <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Ollie Robinson</a>, who was declared not out.</li><li>In November 2023, Marnus didn’t like the idea that the word ‘bazball’ was included in the Collins English Dictionary and labeled it as ‘garbage’.</li><p>Featured Image by Marnus Labuschagne / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqaYq6alqHqtrcGuqpygkZy7pns%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmarnus-labuschagne.html&text=Marnus%20Labuschagne%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Body%20Statistics&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarnus-labuschagne.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarnus-labuschagne.html&title=Marnus%20Labuschagne%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Body%20Statistics" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmarnus-labuschagne.html&title=Marnus%20Labuschagne%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Body%20Statistics" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmarnus-labuschagne.html&title=Marnus%20Labuschagne%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Body%20Statistics" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarnus-labuschagne.html&description=Marnus%20Labuschagne%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Body%20Statistics" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./charles-melton.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charles Melton (Actor) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Family, Career, Fac">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./maksim-chmerkovskiy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maksim Chmerkovskiy News - Us Weekly">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
