However, fans can get a glimpse of his happy life on his wife's Instagram page.</p><p class=dh>"Yellowstone" has been a fan favorite since it first aired in 2018. The drama series features several stars, including Kevin Costner, Cole Hauser, Taylor Sheridan, and Luke Grimes.</p><p class=dh>Grimes, best known as the rugged cowboy Kayce Dutton is one of the stars whose name fans look out for. The 38-year-old has featured in other top movies such as "American Sniper," "Taken 2," and "The Magnificent Seven."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/765c887096d1059a2bbed07edc652166.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Actor Luke Grimes on "Yellowstone" [left] "Yellowstone" actor Luke Grimes and his model wife, Bianca Rodrigues [right] | Photo: facebook.com/yellowstoneparamount instagram.com/realbiancarodrigues</p><p class=dh>While some of his most recent roles threw him into the spotlight, Grimes is not a newbie in the industry. The "True Blood" actor has spent more than a decade in Hollywood and went through the ranks, playing more minor roles initially.</p><p class=dh>Grimes's love for acting was sparked after seeing a charming young Macaulay Culkin presenting an award at the Golden Globes on TV. Grimes was only seven at the time, but he soon became passionate about acting.</p><p class=dh>Angie and Randy, his parents, supported him and his acting ambitions. Grimes' parents even took out a mortgage on their home so that he could attend the American Academy of Drama Arts in New York.</p><p class=dh>Before becoming a famous actor, Grimes explored the music industry and drummed for a local Los Angeles band. The actor once told Rolling Stone that he was more than a drummer for the country band. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/yellowstone-kayce-luke-grimes-country-music-1278783/>said</a>,</p><p class=dh>"I played guitar too and helped write songs for the band, so I got to be more than just the drummer. It was a cool experience."</p><p class=dh>The "Brothers and Sisters" actor intends to make a full-fledged comeback to music in 2022, this time as a solo artist. The "Yellowstone" actor has been writing new songs over the past months.</p><p class=dh>With a thriving acting career and stunning looks, Grimes certainly has all it takes to keep his fans gushing. Unfortunately for fans hoping for a chance with the "Fifty Shades of Grey" actor, Grimes is already in a committed romance.</p><p class=dh>Not many know about Grimes's personal life because he loves to keep it that way. The "Into the Ash" actor would rather talk about his music and movies than his life away from the spotlight. However, his romance with his sweetheart, Brazilian model Bianca Rodrigues, is sometimes featured on her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/realbiancarodrigues/>social media</a> pages.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/d9a2b2adda3b3cdd4aa7f7240511492d.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Luke Grimes attends the premiere party for Paramount Network's "Yellowstone" Season 2 at Lombardi House on May 30, 2019 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>GRIMES AND GILLIAN ZINSER</strong></p><p class=dh>Before tying the knot in 2018, Grimes had had a couple of relationships, but only a few managed to reach the spotlight. One of his first known <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/1326478/Luke-Grimes-wife-is-Luke-Grimes-married-wife-Bianca-Grimes-Gillian-Zinser-girlfriend>relationships</a> was with "90210" actress Gillian Zinser, and their romance began in 2011. The couple <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.bustle.com/articles/59126-is-luke-grimes-single-the-american-sniper-fifty-shades-of-grey-actor-is-dating-someone>was</a> still together as of 2015 but appeared to have split shortly after.</p><p class=dh>Their years together were adventurous, and the former flames looked like the perfect item. They were spotted hanging out on several occasions, and Zinser seems to be a die-hard sea lover.</p><p class=dh>Her Instagram <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/gillianzinser/?hl=en">page</a> is filled with lovely snaps of nature and the sea. Some of her sea adventures were with Grimes, and other times, the lovebirds explored fun activities like shopping and simply enjoying each other.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>LIFE WITH RODRIGUES</strong></p><p class=dh>The relationship between the Duttons is a vital part of the Paramount show, "Yellowstone." Several fans have wondered if Grimes and his on-screen wife, Kelsey Asbille, have off-screen chemistry.</p><p class=dh>Grimes shares a platonic friendship with Asbille despite their perfect appearance in the popular series. However, his natural bond <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a38278617/luke-grimes-yellowstone-wife-bianca-rodrigues-marriage/>lies</a> with his Brazilian model and wife, who he has successfully kept out of the limelight.</p><p class=dh>Late last year, Rodrigues shared a lovely photo of them to celebrate their third anniversary. The cute picture showed the lovebirds enjoying a moment on what looked like a beach.</p><p class=dh>Rodrigues <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CWj2VIhp1RM/>wrote</a> on the sweet anniversary post, "I'm so lucky to have you in my life. Happy anniversary anjo! Te amo." The couple <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://parade.com/1176401/mikebloom/luke-grimes-wife/>shares</a> no children yet, and there is no news of them welcoming any soon. However, they looked fulfilled in each other's arms.</p><p class=dh>Rodrigues's Instagram page shows that she is an accomplished model. She currently stays with Grimes in Montana, where he shoots "Yellowstone." However, their former base was in New York.</p><p class=dh>Grimes and his wife have a lot of similarities, especially their love for country music. The actor once revealed that they are devotees of Canadian prairie troubadour Colter Wall.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>A PRIVATE LIFE</strong></p><p class=dh>There are not many details about Grimes's marriage, which is rare for a celebrity of his caliber. Instead, all information on his personal life is gleaned from Rodrigues's Instagram posts and captions.</p><p class=dh>The model loves to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CH3HfUIHO1J/>flaunt</a> her man on special events like his birthday or their anniversary. In one of her posts, she shared a lovely picture of the movie star sitting by a fireplace. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CZBSjB0rRQd/>captioned</a> it, "Happy birthday to my one and only. I love you anjo."</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Grimes</a> has an Instagram that boasts about 71,000 followers; however, he is never active on his page. The actor has not shared a single post on the page and does not follow anyone.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>"YELLOWSTONE'S" NEW SEASON</strong></p><p class=dh>Now that Season 4 of the famous "Yellowstone" has concluded, fans are eagerly expecting the start of filming for Season 5, so they can plan their next series of weekend rendezvous with the Dutton family, their ranch employees, and the property's expanding list of adversaries.</p><p class=dh>In a recent interview with Deadline, showrunner Taylor Sheridan <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://deadline.com/2021/12/1883-yellowstone-origin-taylor-sheridan-universe-tim-mcgraw-faith-hill-sam-elliott-interview-1234892741/>announced</a> that the fifth season of "Yellowstone" will begin in May this year. In addition, other series such as "1883" and "Mayor of Kingstown" are up for a second season.</p><p class=dh>Fans who want to relive the entire story can binge-watch it on various streaming platforms. However, they would have to subscribe to these platforms. "Yellowstone" has reached the climax of its actions, and season 5 will show fans the final fate of the Dutton family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtvbnBiZXq6sculprCrpKS7pnnSrZirZZyquKZ5xqugpp2jYrimsc%2BsZKGho2K9b7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f285820-yellowstone-star-luke-grimes-keeps-his-p-html.html&text=Yellowstone%20Star%20Luke%20Grimes%20Keeps%20His%20Personal%20Life%20Private%20While%20His%20Wife%20Shares%20Snaps%20of%20Th&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f285820-yellowstone-star-luke-grimes-keeps-his-p-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f285820-yellowstone-star-luke-grimes-keeps-his-p-html.html&title=Yellowstone%20Star%20Luke%20Grimes%20Keeps%20His%20Personal%20Life%20Private%20While%20His%20Wife%20Shares%20Snaps%20of%20Th" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f285820-yellowstone-star-luke-grimes-keeps-his-p-html.html&title=Yellowstone%20Star%20Luke%20Grimes%20Keeps%20His%20Personal%20Life%20Private%20While%20His%20Wife%20Shares%20Snaps%20of%20Th" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f285820-yellowstone-star-luke-grimes-keeps-his-p-html.html&title=Yellowstone%20Star%20Luke%20Grimes%20Keeps%20His%20Personal%20Life%20Private%20While%20His%20Wife%20Shares%20Snaps%20of%20Th" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f285820-yellowstone-star-luke-grimes-keeps-his-p-html.html&description=Yellowstone%20Star%20Luke%20Grimes%20Keeps%20His%20Personal%20Life%20Private%20While%20His%20Wife%20Shares%20Snaps%20of%20Th" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-celebs-who-are-clearly-color-blind-and-need-a-stylist.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Celebs Who Are Clearly Color Blind And Need A Stylist">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-is-brad-pitt-selling-plan-b-entertainment.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Is Brad Pitt Putting Plan B Entertainment Up For Sale Despite Numerous Awards?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
