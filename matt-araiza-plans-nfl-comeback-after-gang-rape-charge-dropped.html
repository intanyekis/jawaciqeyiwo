Now he says he wants to get his career back on track after being cleared of rape. <span class=credit>Justin Truong</span></figure><p>Prosecutors in San Diego announced in December that <a href=#>no rape charges would be filed</a> against Araiza, now 22, and his former Aztecs teammates.</p><p>The video evidence led them to conclude the encounters between Leonard, Ewaliko and the 17-year-old were not clearly forcible.</p><p>Ewaliko was charged with possessing child pornography after his phone was seized and denies the charge.</p><p>“I was happy that there was so much evidence and that this wasn’t a ‘he-said, she-said’ thing,” Araiza, who had always acknowledged having a consensual encounter with the girl outside but denied being part of a violent attack, told The Post.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Araiza’s punting skills were only seen by Bills fans in pre-season training and one pre-season game. He was cut before he made his regular-season NFL debut. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>“A lot of cases like this are and it’s up to a jury kind of guessing. I mean, if there’s no evidence either way, it’s somewhat a guess. I’m grateful that’s not the case in this one.”</p><p>Araiza is now back at home with his parents in Poway, Calif., training hard to try to break back into the NFL — a goal he acknowledges will be tough despite his cleared name, storied collegiate career and once-promising professional start, including <a href=#>an 82-yard preseason smash</a> against the Colts.</p><p>“That’s the goal,” he told The Post. “I think people underestimate how tough it is to make it in the NFL when you’re a free agent and you’ve been out of the game for a year. That just gives teams questions, so I’m just looking for the opportunity to answer those questions.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Buffalo selected Araiza in the sixth-round of the 2022 NFL Draft. He quickly impressed coaches, kicking an 82-yard bomb during a preseason game and appeared to be line to become the team’s starter. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>Araiza said he’s “very confident” he’ll be an asset if given an opportunity, whether in Buffalo or elsewhere. His agent has been in contact with a “couple” of teams, but the special teams maven understands organizations typically don’t want players to be potential “distractions,” he said.</p><p>“I just think it’s a very rare situation, especially being a punter,” Araiza said. “If I were a quarterback — no question — I’d be on a team right now. No question whatsoever, it’s just the position I play.”</p><p>The most difficult period since last summer, Araiza said, was being on the sidelines again.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">This is the 82-yard punt which wowed fans in the Bills’ pre-season game with the Colts — now Araiza wants to get back into the NFL to show his skills in full. <span class=credit>Buffalo Bills</span></figure><p>“It was a journey mentally, for sure,” Araiza said. “It had its ups and downs and there were days I was able to accept it and try to enjoy the little things in life. But then there were days when the big picture was consuming, and I could think about was what I lost.</p><p>“Watching Bills’ games — that was brutal. It was a weird thing because I couldn’t not watch them. I was too invested. Knowing so many of the players personally, the coaches, having spent the offseason with them, it was pretty heartbreaking to watch.”</p><p>Those games pushed Araiza to the brink, he admitted.</p><p>“Angry, cheated,” he said of his emotions. “I felt like I had worked my whole life for this thing and the way it was taken from me was brutal.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Matt Araiza at the Buffalo Bills practice facility in Orchard Park, just weeks before he was released by the team. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Araiza is still being sued by the alleged victim, who offered to settle for $50,000 — an offer he rejected, saying he would consider countersuing her and definitely plans to sue her attorney.</p><p>“I’m not willing to pay money to people who damaged my life irreversibly,” Araiza said. “It’s just not something I’m willing to do. But I will never waive my right to sue her attorney — ever. That lawsuit is coming.”</p><p>Araiza’s attorney, Kerry Armstrong, has <a href=#>called the civil suit a “shakedown,”</a> while the ex-NFL punter isn’t sure if he was accused due to his celebrity status on campus and likely future gridiron success.</p><p>“I don’t know what the motive was, to be honest with you,” he said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Pa’a Ewaliko (left) and Zavier Leonard were not criminally charged in connection to the alleged attack.</figure><p>The woman, now 18, said Thursday that the recordings which convinced prosecutors to drop charges show only a portion of what happens.</p><p>“I don’t think it exonerates anybody,” she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Today Sports</a>.</p><p>For now, Araiza said he’s content continuing to hone his craft until some team comes calling.</p><p>“I’m not really someone who enjoys the spotlight, to be honest with you,” Araiza told The Post. “I enjoy playing sports at the highest level, and with that, comes a little bit of the spotlight, but I’ll never be a ‘me-before-the-team’ guy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25mamlfoq61wIyaqZqhqpZ6sbjAp6pmppaheqS7zJ6ZmpubYq6nwMSrZKCZnpx6s63PnmScoJGntKZ5w6umqaiVmXw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmatt-araiza-plans-nfl-comeback-after-gang-rape-charge-dropped.html&text=Matt%20Araiza%20plans%20NFL%20comeback%20after%20gang-rape%20charge%20dropped&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmatt-araiza-plans-nfl-comeback-after-gang-rape-charge-dropped.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmatt-araiza-plans-nfl-comeback-after-gang-rape-charge-dropped.html&title=Matt%20Araiza%20plans%20NFL%20comeback%20after%20gang-rape%20charge%20dropped" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmatt-araiza-plans-nfl-comeback-after-gang-rape-charge-dropped.html&title=Matt%20Araiza%20plans%20NFL%20comeback%20after%20gang-rape%20charge%20dropped" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmatt-araiza-plans-nfl-comeback-after-gang-rape-charge-dropped.html&title=Matt%20Araiza%20plans%20NFL%20comeback%20after%20gang-rape%20charge%20dropped" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmatt-araiza-plans-nfl-comeback-after-gang-rape-charge-dropped.html&description=Matt%20Araiza%20plans%20NFL%20comeback%20after%20gang-rape%20charge%20dropped" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mufasa-the-lion-king-cast.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mufasa: The Lion King's Cast, Ranked By Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mahesh-babu-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mahesh Babu Net Worth  How Much is Mahesh Babu Worth?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
