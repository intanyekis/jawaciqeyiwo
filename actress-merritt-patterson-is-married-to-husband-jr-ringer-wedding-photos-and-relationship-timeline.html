He is a talent agent.</p><p>The duo went public with their relationship in 2017 when the actress posted pictures of them together on her Instagram handle.</p><p>Although fans have seen the duo together for the last five years, the couple has remained tight-lipped about their relationship. As a result, there is no information regarding how they met for the first time and how they fell in love.</p><p>However, the actress confirmed in 2015 that she was dating but did not disclose the identity of her lover at that time. Many think it was Ringer, and they had been together for a long time.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=she-married-him-in-september-this-year></span>She Married Him In September This Year<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Merritt married her partner, JR Ringer, on September 17, 2022. It has been more than a month since the couple tied the knot.</p><p>Since there was no news about her marriage, it seems the duo got married in a privately held ceremony.

JR began his agency career there, starting in the mailroom shortly after graduating from Indiana University’s Kelly School of Business.</p><p>He worked in various positions after his experience in the mailroom. He worked under Jack Gilardi, Carter Cohn, and Chris Silbermann before being promoted to one of the first coordinators and agents at the reformed ICM Partners.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=merritt-patterson-relationship-timeline></span>Merritt Patterson Relationship Timeline<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Merritt Patterson has kept her love life away from the limelight.
