(Plus, I had a healthy fear of the word 'heroin', a fear we did not share). I punched a hole through Jennifer Aniston's dressing room wall when I found out. I found myself publicly discussing his death from drugs and alcohol. I was high the entire time. "No one knew — not my family, my friends, no one."</p><p>Perry would also share the same story alongside Stephen Colbert. Throughout the interview, Perry was very open and honest about his past.</p><p>Perry tells Colbert, "I put a hole threw her dressing room. Of course, it scared me. But being scared of it wasn't enough." Perry went on to reveal that he got help following Farley's passing, but this was a common occurrence throughout his career.</p><p>Matthew stated that he got help several times, "13 or 14 times," the actor mentioned. The result, millions spent on rehab treatments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Matthew Perry's Final Instagram Post Was Eerie</a></span></p><p>Perry's interview with Stephen Colbert was among his last, and fans appreciated how open and honest he was about his past struggles.
