Fortunately, however, some shows manage to find an audience but even in those cases, it is exceedingly rare for people to care deeply about a show. Thankfully for everyone involved with this popular series, <a href=#>Sons of Anarchy fans care so much about the show to come up with a slew of theories</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Fun Facts Even The Biggest Sons Of Anarchy Fans Don't Know</a></span></p><p>Of course, there were several reasons why Sons of Anarchy fans were so devoted. For example, most fans cared deeply about everyone they saw on the show even though <a href=#>some Sons of Anarchy characters were useless and others were great</a>. Despite how passionate Sons of Anarchy fans seemed to be, most viewers seemed to be oblivious that the cast must have been going through pain. After all, it would have been hard for anyone involved with Sons of Anarchy to forget about a tragic event that involved one of the show’s stars.</p><h2 id=the-shocking-circumstances-of-johnny-lewis-rsquo-final-moments>The Shocking Circumstances Of Johnny Lewis’ Final Moments</h2><p>Throughout Sons of Anarchy’s seven-season run, the show introduced many characters, some of which fans grew to adore. Most notably, it almost seems to be universally agreed upon that Opie was Sons of Anarchy’s best character for many reasons including Ryan Hurst’s performance. However, if a character from Sons of Anarchy’s first two seasons stuck around, he could have been in the running for Opie’s popularity crown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Things You Didn’t Know About Ryan Hurst On Sons Of Anarchy</a></span></p><p>During the first two seasons of Sons of Anarchy, fans got to know Kip 'Half-Sack' Epps, a lovable prospect that everyone thought would become an important member of the show’s titular motorcycle club. Much to the dismay of many Sons of Anarchy viewers, however, Half-Sack shockingly lost his life at the end of the show’s second season. As it would turn out, however, everyone involved must have been relieved that Half-Sack actor Johnny Lewis left the show’s cast based on what happened later.</p><p>In 2012 when Johnny Lewis was only 28-years-old, the actor’s neighbors called the police after he attacked two people and his landlady was heard screaming. Sadly, by the time police arrived, the 81-year-old landlady Catherine Davis and Lewis were found dead. After investigating the scene, police released the details of what had taken place to the public, and to say the events were shocking was an understatement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On September 26th, 2012, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnny Lewis violently took his 81-year-old landlady’s life</a> and the actor even made sure that her cat met its untimely demise. From there, Lewis jumped over a fence and attacked his neighbor and a painter he employed before suddenly leaving the same way he came. Once Lewis was back on his landlady’s property, he either climbed onto her house, her garage, or her patio and then fell by accident. When Lewis landed on the ground, he suffered injuries that were serious enough to swiftly result in the end of his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on the horrific nature of Johnny Lewis’ final deeds and the fact that the actor had a history of addiction issues, many people assumed he was under the influence when he passed. Once an autopsy was completed, however, it was ruled that Lewis didn’t have any alcohol or substances in his system. As a result, there is no way to know what happened to cause Lewis’ abhorrent actions.</p><h2 id=the-sons-of-anarchy-cast-was-in-shock-after-johnny-lewis-39-death>The Sons Of Anarchy Cast Was In Shock After Johnny Lewis' Death</h2><p>To this day, Kurt Sutter is best known as the creator and principal creative mind behind Sons of Anarchy. Given the plot lines that Sons of Anarchy featured and Sutter’s role in that, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that he has an insight into humanity. Still, it was surprising when SOA’s creator posted a blog in which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sutter claimed he wasn’t surprised by the circumstances of Johnny Lewis’ death</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Did Katey Sagal Meet Her Husband Kurt Sutter?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Not sure if folks know this yet, but Johnny Lewis (halfsack) died last night. the sad irony of it happening two days after Opie’s death is not lost on me. It was a tragic end for an extremely talented guy, who unfortunately had lost his way. I wish I could say that I was shocked by the events last night, but I was not. I am deeply sorry that an innocent life had to be thrown into his destructive path”</p><p>When the press learned about Johnny Lewis’ death and how his life ended, many members of the media reached out to Sons of Anarchy’s biggest stars for comment. Understandably, none of the show’s stars responded to those requests. However, according to an E! Online report, an insider summed up<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> how Sons of Anarchy’s cast felt about the circumstances of Lewis' demise</a>. "I would be surprised if any of the actors comment. It wasn't a secret that Johnny had issues he was dealing with. No one could have expected it would end so tragically, though. Everyone is in shock."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the perspective of the TV show, Sons of Anarchy went on without missing a beat after Johnny Lewis’ life came to an end. However, based on the comments of E! Online’s insider, it seems clear that the show’s cast struggled with the situation. While it seems likely that SOA’s stars ultimately moved on from what happened, it seems safe to assume they were plagued by the situation for a while at least.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Charlie Hunnam And The Sons Of Anarchy Cast Have Said About The Show</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqqKajYrynecCnmKubmK56pK3SrWSjp5iju7p5y56uoqtdosKzsMSrZJ2dkam1cA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsons-of-anarchy-cast-johnny-lewis-murder-death.html&text=This%20Shocking%20Tragedy%20Plagued%20The%20Cast%20Of%20Sons%20Of%20Anarchy&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsons-of-anarchy-cast-johnny-lewis-murder-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsons-of-anarchy-cast-johnny-lewis-murder-death.html&title=This%20Shocking%20Tragedy%20Plagued%20The%20Cast%20Of%20Sons%20Of%20Anarchy" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsons-of-anarchy-cast-johnny-lewis-murder-death.html&title=This%20Shocking%20Tragedy%20Plagued%20The%20Cast%20Of%20Sons%20Of%20Anarchy" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsons-of-anarchy-cast-johnny-lewis-murder-death.html&title=This%20Shocking%20Tragedy%20Plagued%20The%20Cast%20Of%20Sons%20Of%20Anarchy" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsons-of-anarchy-cast-johnny-lewis-murder-death.html&description=This%20Shocking%20Tragedy%20Plagued%20The%20Cast%20Of%20Sons%20Of%20Anarchy" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./where-is-quando-rondo-from-find-his-net-worth-girlfriend-age-height-how-old-tall.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where Is Quando Rondo From?
