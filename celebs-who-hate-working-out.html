When she's not obligated by a contract to get in shape, she much prefers juice cleanses. Her most regular form of exercise is walking her pets and doing <a href=#>pilates</a>. She's also very mindful of her posture.</p><h2 id=emma-stone><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Emma Stone</span></h2><p>The La La Land star confessed that she feels rage seething inside of her everytime she is lifting and that she doesn't particularly like the feeling. "I'm usually a pretty peaceful person, but for some reason when I get in the gym something bubbles up in me.... I haven't worked out for a month and I'm proud of it!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Stone </a>might not be a fan of working out, but she had to put a lot of time and effort in for a lot of her movies, such as Spiderman.</p><h2 id=robert-pattinson><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Robert Pattinson</span></h2><p>Working out is one of the many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things Robert Pattinson had to do to prepare for his role of Batman</a>. Since the production was put on pause in 2020, Pattinson saw no reason to stay in shape.</p><p>He believes that those who are obsessed with working out are "part of the problem". For many, working out is not about a healthy lifestyle, but rather about looking as attractive as possible.</p><h2 id=emily-ratajkowski><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Emily Ratajkowski</span></h2><p>The fact that Emily Ratajkowski doesn't really work that hard for her killer body is pretty infuriating. She's not a gym person at all; she much prefers taking long walks with her friends. Her diet is another story, though. She only eats things that are good for her and absolutely swears by juices and turmeric.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The model turned actress is one of those <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrities who are expecting a baby in 2021</a>. Perhaps she will start working out after she's had her baby. For now, it doesn't look like it. She's barely put on any weight during her pregnancy!</p><h2 id=eva-longoria><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Eva Longoria</span></h2><p>Eva Longoria's amazing body doesn't just come to her. The star is committed to her workouts, but that doesn't mean that she enjoys them. She has to do them first thing in the morning. She absolutely hates weights, but she doesn't mind yoga all that much.</p><p>She hates the process of working out, but once she's done, she feels great about herself.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jennifer Lawrence</span></h2><p>Jennifer Lawrence might be a multi-million dollar worth celebrity, but she certainly doesn't act like it. Some find her brutal honesty refreshing and relatable, while others dislike her for it.</p><p>In 2013, she told InStyle&nbsp;that nothing can keep her away from junk food and in an interview for BBC1, she confessed that people who post gym selfies makes her angry. ""Can we just put them all on an island?", she suggested.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rihanna><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Rihanna</span></h2><p>Bad girl Riri knows better than to spend her time or <a href=#>her millions</a> on personal trainers and gyms. She does, however, have her own chef. She doesn't like working out because she finds it boring. It's true: the repetitive moves make time move so much slower, and Rihanna just doesn't have the patience for it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things Rihanna's Been Doing Instead Of Dropping A New Album</a></span></p><p>In 2011, Rihanna told Vogue that she likes her body, "even if it's not perfect according to the book".</p><h2 id=kiera-knightley><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kiera Knightley</span></h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pirates of the Carribean</a> star has told the S Magazine that she cannot stand the gym at all, but she certainly looks as if she had a strict workout regimen.</p><p><span class=related-single><span class=listicle-slide-hed-text>Related: </span><a class=bc-title-link title="10 Celebs Who Admitted They Love Watching The Real Housewives" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Admitted They Love Watching The Real Housewives</a></span></p><p>Kiera must have an amazing metabolism, since she also doesn't follow any strict diets: "I don't think about nutrition. The very thought of a diet makes me want chips and ice cream."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sofia-vergara><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sofia Vergara</span></h2><p>Sofia Vergara doesn't just hate working out, she considers it 'torture'. She doesn't even feel good about herself after she's done: "<span class=ILfuVd><span class=hgKElc>I'm in a bad mood two hours before and while I'm doing it and then I'm done, because I know I have to come back and do it again."</span></span></p><p>The only part of her body that she doesn't mind putting to work is her booty. "We do a lot of squats and deadlifts and lunges," her personal trainer told People.</p><h2 id=blake-lively><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Blake Lively</span></h2><p>Blake Lively might hate the gym, but not as much as she loves chocolate. That's why she has no choice but to go despite her resistance. In 2016, she posted a cute photo on Instagram, hiding from her personal trainer.</p><p>She is not a fan of gym equpiment, but she likes to break a sweat outdoors. "I dance, I ride bicycles, I hike. I go out and exercise in nature."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a class=bc-title-link title="10 Celebs Who Perfected The Art Of The Workout Selfie" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Perfected The Art Of The Workout Selfie</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl8Buw8eoZKGZpJp6uLvRpKCnn12kwrV7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcelebs-who-hate-working-out.html&text=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Can%27t%20Stand%20Working%20Out&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcelebs-who-hate-working-out.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcelebs-who-hate-working-out.html&title=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Can%27t%20Stand%20Working%20Out" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcelebs-who-hate-working-out.html&title=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Can%27t%20Stand%20Working%20Out" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcelebs-who-hate-working-out.html&title=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Can%27t%20Stand%20Working%20Out" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcelebs-who-hate-working-out.html&description=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Can%27t%20Stand%20Working%20Out" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-90s-stars-with-net-worths-you-wont-believe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 90s Stars With Net Worths You Won't Believe">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tim-armstrong-net-worth-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tim Armstrong Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
