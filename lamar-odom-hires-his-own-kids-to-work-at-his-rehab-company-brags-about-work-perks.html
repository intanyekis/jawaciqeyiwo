Her responsibilities include recording patients' information and ensuring they are fully prepared when starting at the rehab.</p><p>Notably, both of Lamar's children also had the opportunity to feature in a commercial for the company, which is set to air on Hulu across multiple locations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lamar made sure to reveal that it’s not all hard work for his kids. To celebrate their new jobs, the former NBA star treated them to a vacation in Orange County, spending a few nights at an oceanfront property in Newport Beach.</p><p>At the beginning of this year, Lamar Odom, who has successfully battled addiction himself, founded the Odom Recovery Group with the aim of assisting others in their journey towards sobriety.</p><p>He embarked on this endeavor following financial difficulties faced by a rehab center called Wavelengths Recovery in Huntington, California, which was on the brink of closure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Initially, Lamar initiated a GoFundMe campaign and organized a silent auction to raise funds for the rehabilitation facility. Since then, Lamar has taken ownership of three treatment centers in California, expressing motivation to assist as many individuals as possible in their journey towards sobriety.</p><p>This isn’t the only project Lamar has launched this year. He’s in the process of <a href=#>establishing a senior living community,</a> driven by his grandmother's recent challenges in finding a suitable and comfortable residence.</p><p>Lamar's manager <a href=#>confirmed this development to TMZ,</a> outlining his collaboration with Regency Palms Senior Living in Oxnard and Long Beach to launch his new venture, known as Odom Senior Care. The company's primary focus will be delivering high-quality senior care with a touch of luxury, all at accessible and affordable rates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Odom Senior Care is already operating two facilities in Southern California. Their ambitious goal is to extend their services to offer housing at pre-negotiated rates in 1,000 communities by the end of the year.</p><p>The athlete emphasizes that existing senior housing options come with exorbitant costs, and he aspires for his initiative to establish a new benchmark, making senior care more affordable and accessible.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: &nbsp;<a href=#>Here’s What Joe Jonas & Sophie Turner's Prenup Entitles Them To Amid Shocking Divorce</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS5ornAq2SonJ%2Bieqm10Z6qZqCZqHqww81moqKco2LBsHnWqKmkZZGpeqm10mapnqCRl3qku8ypmKexXZe%2ForPSZpibp6Wperi70aRkqZ2ioMBw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flamar-odom-hires-his-own-kids-to-work-at-his-rehab-company-brags-about-work-perks.html&text=Lamar%20Odom%20Hires%20His%20Own%20Kids%20To%20Work%20At%20His%20Rehab%20Company%2c%20Brags%20About%20Work%20Perks&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flamar-odom-hires-his-own-kids-to-work-at-his-rehab-company-brags-about-work-perks.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flamar-odom-hires-his-own-kids-to-work-at-his-rehab-company-brags-about-work-perks.html&title=Lamar%20Odom%20Hires%20His%20Own%20Kids%20To%20Work%20At%20His%20Rehab%20Company%2c%20Brags%20About%20Work%20Perks" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flamar-odom-hires-his-own-kids-to-work-at-his-rehab-company-brags-about-work-perks.html&title=Lamar%20Odom%20Hires%20His%20Own%20Kids%20To%20Work%20At%20His%20Rehab%20Company%2c%20Brags%20About%20Work%20Perks" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flamar-odom-hires-his-own-kids-to-work-at-his-rehab-company-brags-about-work-perks.html&title=Lamar%20Odom%20Hires%20His%20Own%20Kids%20To%20Work%20At%20His%20Rehab%20Company%2c%20Brags%20About%20Work%20Perks" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flamar-odom-hires-his-own-kids-to-work-at-his-rehab-company-brags-about-work-perks.html&description=Lamar%20Odom%20Hires%20His%20Own%20Kids%20To%20Work%20At%20His%20Rehab%20Company%2c%20Brags%20About%20Work%20Perks" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nedra-volz-husbands-children-net-worth-movies-age-height-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nedra Volz Death, Husbands, Children, Net Worth, Movies, Age, Height, Wiki-Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./fred-warner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fred Warner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
