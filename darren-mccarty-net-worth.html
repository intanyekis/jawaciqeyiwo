However, all of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Darren McCarty? As of mid-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $500,000, mostly earned through a successful career in professional ice hockey. He won the Stanley Cup with the Red Wings four times in his career, but as he now continues with other endeavors, it is expected that his wealth will continue to increase.</p><h3>Darren Mccarty Net Worth $500,000</h3><p>Darren grew up in Leamington, Ontario, and would later play for Southpoint Capitals minor teams as part of the Ontario Minor Hockey Association (OMHA). Later on, McCarty would join the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), playing for the Belleville Bulls from 1989 to 1992. He became one of the most popular players of the team and would be the captain during his final season with them, and won the Jim Mahon Memorial Trophy for being the top-scoring player of the team.</p><p>He joined the 1992 NHL Entry Draft and would be selected by the Red Wings in the second round. In 1997, he would help the Red Wings win their first Stanley Cup in 42 years, with Darren scoring the cup-clinching goal. They would do it again the following year, and he was credited to have helped break the Red Wings curse after the event called “Fight Night at the Joe”, in which he started fighting Claude Lemieux. The team’s next Stanley Cup win would be in 2002, in which he registered his first hat-trick. All of these achievements increased his net worth.</p><p>McCarty spent 11 seasons with the Red Wings, but he parted ways with them in the 2004 season after the lockout was cancelled, and signed with the Calgary Flames as a free agent, however, in 2006 he only appeared in 32 games and failed to score a single point. The following year, he signed with the International Hockey League (IHL) team, the Flint Generals, and played 10 games with them, before in 2008 signing a professional tryout contract with the Grand Rapids Griffins. He then signed a one year contract with the Red Wings and would help the team win the Stanley Cup in that season, marking a resurgence in his ice hockey career which helped his net worth increase a bit further. In 2009, he was released by the Red Wings, and then announced his official retirement.</p><p>After retirement, he went to work as a color analyst for Versus, and made appearances in the show “Hockey Central”. He was also a fill-in co-host on WXYT-FM in Detroit. In 2012, he appeared in the reality series “Hardcore Pawn”.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that McCarty married Sheryl Sirmons in 2012; they reside in Clawson, Michigan. During the off-season, he was known to play with the hard rock band Grinder, however, the band went on hiatus after their bass player passed away. The McCarty Cancer Foundation has also been established by Darren aimed, at finding a cure for multiple myeloma which afflicted his father.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=3.1230769230769><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Darren McCarty</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$500,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 1, 1972</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Burnaby, Canada</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>210 lbs (95.25 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Ice hockey player</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Canadian</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Sheryl Sirmons (m. 2012), Cheryl McCarty</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Melissa McCarty</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1489355/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>NHL Foundation Player Award</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=1.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>The one thing I remember most is Joey Kocur whispering in my ear: "The next one's better.
