We understand that not everyone is fashion conscious, it’s not something that you are born with. But for the celebrities who don’t have a natural fashion sense, there are stylists that they can hire so that when they go out in the public eye, they aren’t criticized.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These celebrities may be color blind, we’re not sure what the issue is, but if they aren’t, then we don’t understand the colors, designs, or just the choice of clothing they choose to wear. It appears that it doesn’t matter how famous you are or how much money you have, you can be completely clueless when it comes to fashion. These celebrities often find themselves on the worst-dressed list and we have to wonder why that alone doesn’t have them running out to get a stylist.</p><p>You might be wondering what celebrities out there have the worst wardrobes and we have the answers for you. These are the celebrities that can use all the help they can get when it comes to getting dressed. For whatever reason, they can’t seem to do it on their own. We assume that they must love their own sense of style and they are going to continue making us scratch our heads with their fashion choices. Check out these 15 celebs who are clearly color blind and need a stylist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicki-minaj-dresses-like-a-barbie-doll><strong>Nicki Minaj Dresses Like A Barbie Doll</strong></h2><p>We’re not sure why she did it, but Nicki Minaj actually dressed up like Barbie when she was seen in London. The colors alone are a little hard to digest. She was wearing giant pink platform boots, Troll Doll leggings, a Hello Kitty pink leather beret, and a pink Barbie skirt. She got dressed in this massacre of an outfit for the signing of her Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded LP at HMV in Whiteley’s Shopping Centre in London. It’s typical Minaj though; she rarely goes to any type of event without some kind of crazy outfit on. She’s another performer that just doesn’t care what other people think. “I don't mind being called a weirdo. There are a lot of people in hip-hop who are probably never going to get what I do. But, by just being myself, I end up touching a lot more people who might never have paid much attention to a female rapper.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cate-blanchett-is-dressed-in-gold-clearly><strong>Cate Blanchett Is Dressed In Gold...Clearly</strong></h2><p>Cate Blanchett is a classy woman and a very talented actress, but she has had her fair share of fashion fails. This dress is glitzy and a little much for the eyes. We’re surprised she would choose a dress that is gold and completely made of sequins. There are so many classy dresses that would have suited her much better than this one. She has always been a class act in Hollywood, though, and there is a lot of respect for her in the industry. She just needs a stylist. “I don't have a sense of entitlement or that I deserve this. You'd be surprised at the lack of competition between nominees&nbsp;— I think a lot of it is imposed from the outside. Can I have my champagne now?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=we-expect-nothing-less-from-lady-gaga><strong>We Expect Nothing Less From Lady Gaga</strong></h2><p>Whether she’s dressed like a swan or wearing lunch meat, Lady Gaga has taken personal fashion down a few notches. Although many of her wild outfits are seen either on the red carpet or onstage, Lady Gaga doesn't even shy away from color when she's out and about. Some might say that it's part of her persona, but we just think that she's creative inside and outside, so why should she hold back? "I don't think I could live without hair, makeup, and styling, let alone be the performer I am. I am a glamour girl through and through. I believe in the glamorous life and I live one.”</p><h2 id=girl-crush-tanks-it-at-the-grammys><b>Girl Crush Tanks It At the Grammys</b></h2><p>We have to honestly wonder what goes through someone’s head when they put on an outfit like this one. She was essentially wearing a bright pink bikini top with a ball gown — literally. It was a horrendous and way too bright of an option for that event. Why would anyone want to look like a ball pit? Especially when you are going to a prestigious award event like the Grammys? It’s almost too insulting to look at. Girl Crush is a really beautiful girl so she could have done really well by wearing an elegant gown. It wasn’t like she was going to a kid’s birthday party, so we’re not sure why she decided on this ridiculous get-up aside from needing attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=solange-knowles-looked-like-big-bird><strong>Solange Knowles Looked Like Big Bird</strong></h2><p>You know when you have a loose thread on your clothing and someone tries to&nbsp;break it off for you? We are betting that there were multiple people trying to pick those threads off her sweater dress. The color is quite lovely, but the style is just something we would not expect Solange to wear. She was bound to get a Big Bird joke from someone as she walked around in that outfit. We’re not sure if there are threads sticking out or feathers, but it’s just not an appealing outfit. She believes that confidence makes a woman foxy, so maybe she actually thought she looked great in this little number. “If I had to define 's*xy' now, as Disney as it sounds, I would have to say it's about complete and utter confidence.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pink-wears-a-feather-pillow><strong>Pink Wears A Feather Pillow</strong></h2><p>Not quite, but it sure does look like those throw pillows we've seen. This dress is tacky and the colors are bizarre for the Grammys. She looks like one big feather duster and it’s unfortunate because she could have pulled off something really amazing if she would have tried. When it comes to Pink, she believes in overdressing, so she certainly has pulled that off. “I believe in manicures. I believe in overdressing. I believe in primping at leisure and wearing lipstick. I believe in pink. I believe happy girls are the prettiest girls. I believe that tomorrow is another day, and, I believe in miracles.” We certainly agree with her philosophy, but we just hope that she starts consulting with a stylist before the next red-carpet event.</p><h2 id=bella-thorne-s-style-is-blinding><strong>Bella Thorne’s Style Is Blinding</strong></h2><p>When it comes to Bella Thorne’s sense of style, it can sometimes be a mystery to us. She has worn some of the most offensive outfits imaginable. It’s gotten to the point where we have to wonder if she’s not just color blind, but entirely blind. If there's one thing about Thorne, she doesn't really care what people think of her. Ever since she left the Disney Channel, it’s almost as if she feels she has to prove that she is an adult. She does whatever she wants, whenever she wants, and if you glance at her Instagram page, you will know exactly what we are talking about. We have a feeling that her crazy fashion sense has more to do with telling the world that she doesn’t care what they think of her, she’s just going to keep doing her thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=solange-knowles-is-at-it-again><strong>Solange Knowles Is At It Again</strong></h2><p>Solange Knowles sure likes her golds and yellows. Many people thought she looked like a gold goddess on the red carpet but we think that she pushed the boundaries a little too far. They went so far as to say that she&nbsp;outshone&nbsp;her sister when all we feel is that we are being blinded by the light. The style is overbearing and the color is way too “extra.” The pleated dress came off as an old-fashion style to us and we’re not sure that she can even pull it off. It may have been better if the dress was more form fitting or&nbsp;had a train. But between the color and the pleats, we are going to say no all over this Grammy dress. Sorry, Solange.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=singer-halsey-wore-her-pajamas><strong>Singer Halsey Wore Her Pajamas</strong></h2><p>There are seriously no words for this outfit and it’s a little appalling that these singers think it’s okay to go to an event dressed like this. They seriously need to start taking fashion queues from Beyoncé and Taylor Swift. Halsey decided to not only wear what appears to be bright-blue satin pyjamas, but she also decided to let it all hang out as well. What is fashionable about this outfit? It seems like it’s just another way to try to stay relevant in your industry. The pyjamas looked like they were easily a double XL on the slight frame of the singer and you couldn’t even see her feet on the runway because the pants just overflowed her feet. We’re not really surprised that she made the worst dressed list that year.</p><h2 id=taraji-p-henson-wears-planets-on-her-dress><strong>Taraji P. Henson Wears Planets On Her Dress</strong></h2><p>Taraji P. Henson not only decided to wear a mini dress to the Grammys, but it was pastel purple with planets all over it. Planets! We’ve seen a lot of mini dresses over the years so it’s not even so much that she wore a mini dress, but why the purple and why were there planets all over it? There are literally lightning bolts on the front of her dress. Of all the dresses that you could wear to an awards event, we’re not sure why she would wear this one. Maybe try this number out at a party, but not a prestigious event. It was a little embarrassing that she showed up wearing something like this. She certainly wasn’t exuding elegance or beauty in this weird planetary dress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kali-uchis-clearly-loves-her-pink><strong>Kali Uchis Clearly Loves Her&nbsp;Pink</strong></h2><p>We’re not sure if maybe Kali Uchis is actually color blind to put on an outfit like this one. She literally dazzled on the red carpet, but it was more of a blinding light from her outfit. We’re not sure what made her choose this one, but the Colombian-American singer should have asked a stylist for a little bit of help. Not only was it a pink and gold outfit, but it was also a jumpsuit and it did not flatter her figure. She was certainly put on the worst-dressed list and we hope that she considers a dress for the next event.&nbsp;We can understand how some of these singers want to show their creative side through fashion, but it's just not working.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-cyrus-is-a-wild-child><strong>Miley Cyrus Is A Wild Child</strong></h2><p>We've been watching Miley Cyrus’ implode in the form of her bad fashion sense for years. Between her horrendous concert attire and the fact that she can’t seem to go anywhere without her tongue hanging out of her mouth, she’s been a little hard to take. That feeling has resonated with us for a few years now and we had to wonder if it had something to do with her breakup with Liam Hemsworth. Now that the two seemed to have patched things up, we hope she’s going to consider making a few changes in her wardrobe. It would be nice to include a couple of normal-looking outfits rather than always look like a rainbow exploded on her or like she forgot to actually wear clothes. No matter what, though, we love our Miley.</p><h2 id=jacqueline-van-bierk-wore-classic-cds><strong>Jacqueline Van Bierk Wore Classic CDs</strong></h2><p>It’s seriously moments like this&nbsp;where you have to ask yourself if someone has lost their mind. We cannot believe that Jacqueline Van Bierk showed up to the Grammys looking like this. Looking at this dress just hurts our eyes. Every single thing is wrong with her outfit. Her hair is green, her gloves are green, and her gown is covered in CDs. If anyone ever needed a stylist, it's this girl. She is fairly new to the electronic music scene but there is no excuse for this dress. She posted on Instagram with this caption: “Having a blast at the #Grammys2017 wearing my inspirations!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maya-rudolph-s-floral-blunder><strong>Maya Rudolph's Floral Blunder</strong></h2><p>Maya Rudolph wore this floral disaster to the 2018 SAG&nbsp;Awards and it was an unfortunate dress choice. Sometimes, comedians feel like they are above being a fashionista, but that shouldn’t be the case at all. Tina Fey certainly changed the way that she dressed at red-carpet events and these days, she is really classing it up. We’re not sure if she doesn’t care about the way she looks or if she did and assumed that this floral number was a great choice for the event. It’s far too dowdy for our tastes. She has certainly worried more about her career and living her dream life than about her fashion choices. “I learned the enormous power of writing for yourself, especially now that people seem to be receptive to the fact that women can write.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=patrick-starr-blew-us-away-with-her-ensemble><strong>Patrick Starr Blew Us Away with Her Ensemble</strong></h2><p>We don’t understand what Patrick Starr was thinking with this bright pink and purple dress. She must have been color blind to put this dress and matching pink boots on. She may be a makeup artist, but that’s no excuse to have such a bold and outrageous outfit. Is it a dress or is it a pair of booty shorts? It’s a terrible look for a prestigious event and we’re surprised she even tried to pull it off. It’s not the first time&nbsp;she has made bold fashion choices, but in this case, we feel it was an absolute disaster. It kind of reminds us of the fortune tellers we see at the carnival. It was a terrible choice for this makeup artist and we hope that she gets herself a good stylist.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKypobJwfZRmmp6klZfAbsPHqGSaqpVisK2xwKujsmWTpLmwvoybo6KmlGKur7CMp5yenF2WerTA2KWgrKxf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-celebs-who-are-clearly-color-blind-and-need-a-stylist.html&text=15%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Clearly%20Color%20Blind%20And%20Need%20A%20Stylist&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-celebs-who-are-clearly-color-blind-and-need-a-stylist.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-celebs-who-are-clearly-color-blind-and-need-a-stylist.html&title=15%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Clearly%20Color%20Blind%20And%20Need%20A%20Stylist" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-celebs-who-are-clearly-color-blind-and-need-a-stylist.html&title=15%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Clearly%20Color%20Blind%20And%20Need%20A%20Stylist" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-celebs-who-are-clearly-color-blind-and-need-a-stylist.html&title=15%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Clearly%20Color%20Blind%20And%20Need%20A%20Stylist" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-celebs-who-are-clearly-color-blind-and-need-a-stylist.html&description=15%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Clearly%20Color%20Blind%20And%20Need%20A%20Stylist" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alexis-bailey-slain-teen-tristyn-baileys-sister-puts-heart-shaped-stones-into-jar-in-florida-court.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alexis Bailey: Why slain teen Tristyn Bailey's sister put 114 heart-shaped stones into jar at court">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./285820-yellowstone-star-luke-grimes-keeps-his-p-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Yellowstone Star Luke Grimes Keeps His Personal Life Private While His Wife Shares Snaps of Th">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
