Just because you see an advertisement that is selling a dog for $100 does not mean the cost ends there. It continues throughout the life of the animal, just like a human being. They require habitats, food, and frequent visits to the veterinarian's office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A basic pet, like a dog, for example, is going to cost the average taxpayer anywhere from $30,000 to $50,000, on average, for about ten years. That number does not include any kind of special visits to the vet's office either. That is just for the housing, food, and care of a basic pet dog.</p><p>So imagine if you owned something more exotic, like a Cotton Top Tamarin or Ringtail Lemur. There is no way that either of these two animals&nbsp;are going to end up costing less than a pet dog. The lifespan alone is going to surpass that of a dog's, easily.</p><p>Then there are the animals that aren't legal to own unless you run a wildlife sanctuary or zoo, like the Panda or a Koala Bear. These animals are definitely not the types of animals you can just go purchase at Pet Smart.</p><p>But for this type of article, let's go ahead and assume that all animals are legal to purchase. In other words, if you walked into a zoo and could choose any animal in the entire place, you could do so and not have to bother with all the red tape and legal permits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With that said, here are the 30 Animals That Would Be The Most Expensive To Own.</p><h2 id=arctic-fox-cost-900>Arctic Fox (Cost: $900)</h2><p>via Pinterest.com</p><p>For the animal lovers on a budget, looking to own something a bit more exotic than a dog or cat, the Arctic Fox is a great place to start because it has such a reasonable price tag; under $1,000. You can get an Arctic Fox cheaper than a lot of pure breed dogs.</p><p>You will be responsible for giving them an enclosure big enough to be able to run, dig, play, and urinate without you having to smell it because&nbsp;that is probably not a smell that anyone wants near them.</p><h2 id=crocodile-cost-1-100>Crocodile (Cost: $1,100)</h2><p>via Wikipedia.com</p><p>Look, there appears to be no legal reason why you cannot own a Crocodile in most U.S. states, but why would you? Honestly, give us some feedback here. What&nbsp;are the benefits to owning a reptile that is more like a dinosaur than anything else in the species?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And let's not forget about its incredible power and super strong outer shell. If you have seen the recent movie "Rampage" then you will understand that there is a good reason why owning a Crocodile is a bad idea.</p><h2 id=micro-piglet-cost-2-000>Micro Piglet (Cost: $2,000)</h2><p>via WallpaperCave.com</p><p>The only reason, and we mean the only reason, we included the Micro Piglet in our list is because people are paying $2,000 for these tiny pigs as the fad continues to grow.</p><p>However, there is a misunderstanding about Micro, or mini, pigs and it has to do with their size. If you buy a dog, you already know what size they are going to end up. But many owners buy Micro Piglet's and treat them as though they are fully grown, which they are not. You could buy a so-called "Mini Pig" from a breeder and spend all this money only to end up with a 75 pound beast because a Vietnamese Pot Bellied big is still exactly that.</p><h2 id=fennec-fox-cost-2-500>Fennec Fox (Cost: $2,500)</h2><p>via Reddit.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the internet continues to grow, so does the amount of people looking for those animals that no one else has, just to be different. One way an exotic pet can grow into a popular pet is their level of cuteness and the Fennec Fox is a 9/10!</p><p>The Fennec Fox is shy and loves their giant ears to be stroked. It soothes them and sends them into a relaxation state that most dogs enter when you rub their nose. It is tough to train them but that should not matter if you can afford to buy one.</p><h2 id=tiger-cub-cost-2-600>Tiger Cub (Cost: $2,600)</h2><p>via Wikipedia.com</p><p>A recent study provided shocking results as there are between 6,000 and 10,000 tigers currently owned throughout the United States, which is more than there are in the wild.</p><p>A Tiger is a cat but it is also a predator that can grow to nearly 700 pounds, have a length of about 12 feet, and can reach as high as 4 feet tall while standing on their four legs. Then, of course, the Tiger has these claws and fangs that could rip the doors off a Ford F-150 with ease.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The cost of food alone is going to run you between $1,000 and $2,000 per month.</p><h2 id=kangaroo-cost-3-000>Kangaroo (Cost: $3,000)</h2><p>via Dreamlandia.com</p><p>If you do not live in Australia, and you want to own a Kangaroo, you need to consider a few things first.</p><p>For starters, is there a vet nearby that knows how to medically treat a Kangaroo? That is probably going to be one of the toughest things to find in the United States because of their rarity as pets in America.</p><p>The Kangaroo also needs plenty of space to survive and if you build a fence, it must be higher than 15 feet tall because a Kangaroo running at full speed can jump that high. Amazing!</p><h2 id=kinkajou-cost-3-200>Kinkajou (Cost: $3,200)</h2><p>via Pinterest</p><p>What is a Kinkajou? It is actually not a monkey or ferret, as they have been mistaken for in the past, rather it is similar to the raccoon and can weigh between 3-10 pounds and stand under two feet tall. Paris Hilton owns one for some odd reason.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The overall cost of a Kinkajou could end up being much cheaper than all the other animals on the list because the cost to feed them is likely to run you about $10 per week. As for the cage, it is going to need to be large enough that the Kinkajou can be comfortable but not so big that it will break the bank. You are looking at maybe $250 for a nice size cage.</p><h2 id=two-toed-sloth-cost-3-500>Two-Toed Sloth (Cost: $3,500)</h2><p>via Wikipedia.com</p><p>By the time we finish writing this sentence, the Two-Toed Sloth will move his hand from his waist to his chest, en route to scratching their nose. That's because they move slower than all the other animals on our list. In fact, they are known to be the slowest, and laziest, animals in the world.</p><p>It is not easy to build a reputation as being super slow and lazy, that is something these sloths had to earn over time. And now, apparently, people want them as pets because of their cuteness and low maintenance care.</p><h2 id=ringtail-lemurs-cost-3-600>Ringtail Lemurs (Cost: $3,600)</h2><p>via WallpaperCave.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Ringtail Lemur, King Julien, was the funniest character in the Madagascar movies and also one of the more popular animals as a result.</p><p>And if we learned anything about Americans, it is that when an animal becomes popular, people are going to want to own one. But there is one major issue about the Ringtail Lemur that no one tells you. It has been illegal to export, or own, one since the mid-60's. So if you think you are getting a pure breed Ringtail Lemur from Madagascar, think again.</p><p>If you do end up with one, be ready to max out your credit cards because the costs to care for one of these things can run you $7,000 a year.</p><h2 id=zebra-cost-4-000>Zebra (Cost: $4,000)</h2><p>via Wikipedia.com</p><p>Even as one of the most aggressive animals in the world, the Zebra is still not an exotic animal that is banned from owning as a pet. You just have to check your state laws to see if it is possible or not. West Virginia has some of the fewest restrictions for exotic-pet ownership along with Wisconsin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So if you decide you want to build your own personal Madagascar family, you need to get on a plane and get out to the East Coast ASAP.</p><p>Just remember that a Zebra is not a pet you can snuggle with on the sofa. You are going to have to leave him to graze in an open field from afar.</p><h2 id=cotton-top-tamarin-cost-4-100>Cotton Top Tamarin (Cost: $4,100)</h2><p>via Wikipedia.com</p><p>If you make the leap and buy a Cotton Top Tamarin, you need to be aware that putting a diaper on a pet monkey is not as easy as a human baby. No matter how bad your child is, they will forever be easier than a monkey. But you have to wrap them in a diaper so make sure it is what you want to get involved with before making a purchase.</p><p>They are by far the cutest monkeys on the list because of their size and overall nature but if they group up, watch out.</p><h2 id=wallaby-cost-4-350>Wallaby (Cost: $4,350)</h2><p>via TrevorsBirding.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If&nbsp;you have a need for a pouched animal and the Kangaroo is just too big for your liking, then the Wallaby is your best bet. The biggest difference is, of course, their size as the Kangaroo is around six feet tall while the Wallaby can reach as high as two and a half feet. That is a massive difference if you do not have a lot of land to allow them to roam freely and be happy.</p><p>Aside from the decent size price tag for the baby wallaby, the cost to care for them, including food, could run you around $500 per month. They also need plenty of land to run around and roam, do not let their size fool you.</p><h2 id=finger-monkey-cost-4-400>Finger Monkey (Cost: $4,400)</h2><p>via Certapet.com</p><p>As cute as a Finger Monkey is, that all ends when the first bill comes to your front door and you see just how expensive these things actually are to own as pets.</p><p>Not only will you have to shell out the $4,400 to buy one, you will also have to house it in a monkey cage that is going to cost you about the same as the monkey itself. A good Finger Monkey cage is going to average about $4,000. It is a one time cost but you are at $8,000 right off the bat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bengal-cat-cost-4-500>Bengal Cat (Cost: $4,500)</h2><p>via PurrfectCatBreeds.com</p><p>A Bengal Cat is a cross breed between a domestic cat and an Asian Leopard Cat. Over generations, the Bengal Cat became more and more beautiful and intelligent, making it one of the most popular cat breeds in the United States today.</p><p>The only thing scarier than a smart cat is an even smarter Bengal Cat because they understand how to manipulate owners. They can learn things and remember their owner's schedules and later use it to benefit themselves. It is like owning a tiny, furry human being.</p><h2 id=english-bulldog-cost-5-000>English Bulldog (Cost: $5,000)</h2><p>via EatSleepWalk.com</p><p>Finally, a dog breed that millions of people around the world own.</p><p>The English Bulldog is known for having serious health problems but that does not stop people from buying them. They are one of the silliest dog breeds that people love to have fun with because of their fun loving antics.</p><p>They are expensive because of their bloodlines, and, like with most dogs, the more pure the bloodlines, the more it is going to cost you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=owl-monkey-cost-5-900>Owl Monkey (Cost: $5,900)</h2><p>via Wired.com</p><p>The Owl Monkey is one of the few pets that you might have to invest in multiple monkeys instead of owning just the one because they live in very small social groups. If you own one, you better be ready for spending many nights wide awake as the Owl Monkeys are the only nocturnal monkey in the entire world.</p><p>Since the average Owl Monkey lives to be about 20 years old, that could mean you might have to change your lifestyle if you really want to enjoy having one of these monkeys as a pet. Otherwise, you will spend your days playing with a sleeping monkey and your nights with a loud, playful monkey looking for some fun.</p><h2 id=capuchin-monkey-cost-8-500>Capuchin Monkey (Cost: $8,500)</h2><p>via Wikipedia.com</p><p>If the Owl Monkey is a bit too much for you to handle, then the next best thing is a Capuchin Monkey, also known as the monkey&nbsp;Marcel from the hit television show Friends. As fun as Marcel looked during the television series, they failed to show you an accurate depiction of what it is like to own a monkey such as him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since they will live to be between 18-20 years old, you need to begin planning for a lifetime of diaper changing, late nights, and the occasional mating season where they turn into the more aggressive of pet monkeys. They are not so dangerous that you should avoid them completely, just do your research before footing the bill for one.</p><h2 id=bongo-antelope-cost-9-000>Bongo Antelope (Cost: $9,000)</h2><p>via Wikipedia.com</p><p>Since the Eastern Bongos are endangered, one would assume that owning a Bongo Antelope is referring to the Western Bongos, who are not quite endangered, yet.</p><p>Some fun facts to know about the Bongo Antelope is that they are the largest forest antelope in all of Africa, are very sociable animals, and their appearance is beneficial to them for multiple reasons including fighting other animals using their dangerous looking horns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you are still curious why they garner such a high price it is due to the fact that there are only two subspecies of them (Western and Eastern) and one is already endangered while the other is heading towards the endangered list very rapidly.</p><h2 id=toucan-cost-10-000>Toucan (Cost: $10,000)</h2><p>via thinklink.com</p><p>A parrot can be one of the most time-consuming pets to own due to their intelligence combined with being super needy, which can be seen as overly loving to their owners. But that requires time and effort that many people just do not realize upon purchasing one of these birds.</p><p>The thing that makes the Toucan such a high-priced pet is their dietary requirements. They tend to love the most expensive fruits like papaya and mangos. Plus, they need a nice selection of toys to choose from and play with. Since they get bored very easily, it is a good idea to keep a stockpile of new toys so that you can replace them every few months.</p><p>But the most important aspect about owning a Toucan is the living space they require. They are not your typical house birds, they need an enclosure that can cost upwards of $5,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hyacinth-macaw-cost-12-000>Hyacinth Macaw (Cost: $12,000)</h2><p>via Wikipedia.com</p><p>Let's take a moment to look at the overall costs of owning a Hyacinth Macaw before you make any rash decisions for shelling out $12,000 for one.</p><p>As far as food goes, between seed mix, pellet food, fresh fruits and veggies, you are looking at around $125 per month on food alone. Next comes the vet costs, and for a bird like the Macaw, those costs are going to be significant and could range anywhere from $250 to $2,000 per visit, depending on what is wrong with them, of course. Then there are the boarding costs, assuming you go on a vacation.</p><p>If you buy a parrot, you are in store for a lifelong commitment of taking care, raising it, and caring for it. It is not like a dog, it requires a bit more.</p><h2 id=ocelot-cost-15-000>Ocelot (Cost: $15,000)</h2><p>via Wikipedia.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of all the pets on this list, the Ocelot is one of the only ones that has created a set schedule for themselves over years and years of evolution. They are most active in the early morning hours and during the evening hours, usually spending their time hunting and marking their territory (if you ever have been to a Zoo and seen an Ocelot exhibit, then you know what their urine smells like so imagine them doing that in your backyard all day).</p><p>Why anyone would want to own an Ocelot is beyond us because it is not a friendly cat. It is known as a wildcat for a reason and they should be left alone to live in the wild, not locked up in a house, or in a cage, all day.</p><h2 id=palm-cockatoo-cost-16-000>Palm Cockatoo (Cost: $16,000)</h2><p>via Wikipedia.com</p><p>The Palm Cockatoo is on the endangered species list and is currently mainly being owned for breeding purposes only. So, although you are not required to breed them upon purchasing one, it would be beneficial to the species to make sure that you do your best to help grow their population as quickly as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These birds are known as "love sponges" because of how much they love their owners. They actually become a little too needy. They require patience and plenty of time and attention, more than any other bird. They are the closest thing to raising a human child as animals come.</p><h2 id=savannah-cat-cost-20-000>Savannah Cat (Cost: $20,000)</h2><p>via Wallpaper.com</p><p>The Savannah Cat is one of those newer breeds of pets that has become a status symbol among the rich, similarly to the Egyptian days when Cats were treated as Gods.</p><p>These Savannah Cats are as beautiful as they are scary. They are cute and cuddly and are very similar to regular house cats but they have a temperament that can change in an instant.</p><p>With such a massive cost to purchase one, you would have to make sure that you are also prepared to invest in a trusted vet for all of its' medical care.</p><h2 id=camels-cost-55-000>Camels (Cost: $55,000)</h2><p>via Wikipedia.com</p><p>At $55,000, the price tag on a Camel is actually not as bad as it would seem because they can live to be 50 years old. That means you will be committed to this pet until you are well into your 80's. Imagine that for a second.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What makes it even worse is that they eat alfalfa hay or oat hay but they can actually eat similar to a horse and they enjoy Bermuda grass too. So the cost is probably going to run you about $250 per month to feed just one of them.</p><h2 id=koala-value-100-000>Koala (Value: $100,000)</h2><p>Via ColoredClovers.com</p><p>The Koala Bear is currently the sixth most expensive animal to own but that is based on the value, and not the food. Imagine having to feed a Koala Bear since they exclusively eat eucalyptus, which is expensive for various reasons. Zoos estimate that the average cost to feed one Koala bear for a year is around $1,100,000 million due to the sensitivity of the eucalyptus plant.</p><p>The problem with owning a Koala Bear is that, even if you can afford to buy one, the food alone makes it the third most costly animal on the planet to own. If not for such a low population worldwide, the costs could eventually go down. But as of today, that is not going to change much since poachers and hunters continue to tear apart their homes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hippopotamus-value-110-000>Hippopotamus (Value: $110,000)</h2><p>via WallpaperCave.com</p><p>An animal like the Hippopotamus does not get to be one of the largest animals in the world by eating wheat bread&nbsp;and drinking Fiji water. They consume an estimated 100 pounds of food per day. That is not per week, it is per day. Since they eat grass and other greens, shoots, and reeds, if you look at the cost for those types of vegetables today, that would be $0.50 per pound, or $18,000 per year, in food.</p><p>For perspective purposes, 100 pounds of vegetables would fill up the back of a pickup truck. They eat that much food every day.</p><h2 id=white-lion-cubs-cost-138-000>White Lion Cubs (Cost: $138,000)</h2><p>via LATimes.com</p><p>It is tough to find a White Lion Cub outside of a controlled environment, like a zoo, but when someone does find them for sale, they have a pretty nice price tag of nearly $140,000 per cub.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because of the scarcity of these extremely rare Lion Cubs, finding a breeder is even tougher. Normally, when that breeder is found, they get whatever the asking price is for the cubs. The cost comes from the white coloring, which is so rare, you might spend years without ever coming across one for sale.</p><h2 id=polar-bear-value-400-000>Polar Bear (Value: $400,000)</h2><p>via wikipedia.com</p><p>Surprisingly, the value shown her for a polar bear comes directly from a report that was requested by the FBI to find out what the price tag of a Polar Bear would end up costing someone. The report focused solely on Canadian Polar Bears, as there are around 15,000 of them throughout their Northern territories. The total cost was estimated to be about $6.3 billion, and when you divide that by the 15,000, you end up with about $400,000 per Polar Bear.</p><p>It is fun to dream but don't expect to own one of these anytime soon. They weigh as much as 1,200 pounds and can stand upwards of 10 feet tall. So good luck trying to tell that monster to sit.</p><h2 id=elephant-value-1-6-million-lifetime>Elephant (Value: $1.6 Million, Lifetime)</h2><p>via Zsl.org</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the most heartbreaking animals in the world is an Elephant because so many poachers and hunters have killed so many of them that they are in danger of&nbsp;joining the critically endangered species list. So it makes sense to say that our estimated value is for ones that are alive, not dead.</p><p>The cost of caring for an Elephant per year is now estimated to be around $100,000, which includes food and all other care. They are so valuable because they are normally the biggest attractions at any zoo, literally.</p><h2 id=panda-value-2-million-rental-fee>Panda (Value: $2 Million, Rental Fee)</h2><p>via ZooAtlanta.com</p><p>One of the most expensive animals in the world today is not a thoroughbred racing horse or a prize-winning show dog, it is the Panda because of their rarity around the globe. They currently have a rental fee of around $2 million that goes to China, where they are raised.</p><p>Pandas International estimates that the care of a Panda can run a zoo around $10,000 per year while the food costs can climb all the way to $500,000 thanks to their large amount of food intake per day, around 35 pounds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They can live up to around ten years so their total cost can cost you about $8 or $9 million.</p><p>(Source: ZooAtlanta, LATimes, Wiki, BigCatRescue, DoughRoller, ExoticAnimalsForSale)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5JpZJqmmaKurb%2BMrZ%2BarF2svLa4w2aZnmWknbJuuc6sq2adqKWyr7%2FIr5xmrJ9ivLi6jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f30-animals-that-would-be-the-most-expensive-to-own.html&text=30%20Animals%20That%20Would%20Be%20The%20Most%20Expensive%20To%20Own&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f30-animals-that-would-be-the-most-expensive-to-own.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f30-animals-that-would-be-the-most-expensive-to-own.html&title=30%20Animals%20That%20Would%20Be%20The%20Most%20Expensive%20To%20Own" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f30-animals-that-would-be-the-most-expensive-to-own.html&title=30%20Animals%20That%20Would%20Be%20The%20Most%20Expensive%20To%20Own" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f30-animals-that-would-be-the-most-expensive-to-own.html&title=30%20Animals%20That%20Would%20Be%20The%20Most%20Expensive%20To%20Own" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f30-animals-that-would-be-the-most-expensive-to-own.html&description=30%20Animals%20That%20Would%20Be%20The%20Most%20Expensive%20To%20Own" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./denisse-acosta-died.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A woman named Denisse Acosta died after being trapped in her vehicle following a crash in Meriden">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./prince-fielder-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Prince Fielder Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
