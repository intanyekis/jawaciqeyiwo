In wake of his passing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Sandler made sure to honor his late one-time colleague, as well as their iconic scene</a>, in a sweet Tweet. "The man. The myth. The best. Such a sweet, funny guy to hang out with. Loved laughing with him. Loved him kicking the crap out of me," he wrote. Rest in peace to a legend of the small screen, and the big.</p><h2 id=happy-gilmore-is-a-90s-comedy-classic>Happy Gilmore Is A 90s Comedy Classic</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/adam-sandler.jpg><p>Back in 1996, Happy Gilmore made its way into theaters and was able to find a major audience in no time. The film, which starred a young Adam Sandler, had a simple premise that was executed brilliantly by the talented cast. It wound up being a success that helped establish Sandler as a comedy star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to the film's release, Sandler had already been on Saturday Night Live and had starred in movies like Airheads and Billy Madison. Happy Gilmore was a noticeable step up for the actor, and according to Box Office Mojo, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it wound up netting more than $40 million worldwide</a>. Considering its small budget of just $12 million, this was considered a major win at the time.</p><p>When looking at Sandler's body of work, Happy Gilmore remains one of his best and most memorable movies to date. Despite the fact that the movie is more than 25 years old, it still holds up as hilarious and still ropes in new fans each year. It has an endless amount of quotable lines, and some of the iconic scenes in this movie remain just as hilarious as they were back in the 90s.</p><p>The film's most memorable scene, though, is one which featured a rumble on the golf course. It also just so happened to feature one Bob Barker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jackie Sandler: 10 Things Fans Didn't Know About Adam Sandler's Wife</a></span></p><h2 id=bob-barker-made-a-surprise-appearance-in-the-film>Bob Barker Made A Surprise Appearance In The Film</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/adam-sandler-and-bob-barker.jpg><p>Seeing Bob Barker in Happy Gilmore came as quite a surprise to movie fans, as Barker was best known for his work on The Price is Right. The legendary Barker was already in his 70s when he made his appearance in Happy Gilmore, so you can only imagine how surprised people were to see him fighting Adam Sandler in the movie. It was perfect casting on Sandler's part, and it made the scene even funnier than it already was.</p><p>Barker, however, was not Sandler's first pick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Sandler</a>, "[Tim] Herlihy initially wrote Ed McMahon. I remember being so young and cocky then that we would literally say when we sent it to Ed McMahon, we thought, ‘Of course he’s going to do it. It would be good for him. It’d be good for his career to be in a movie with me and get in a fistfight.’”</p><p>McMahon never got back to Sandler. However, Sandler was determined to have an older performer join the cast, and continued to reach out. Thankfully, Bob Barker was willing to work with the young Sandler in what ultimately became one of the funniest and most memorable movie scenes from the 90s.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Every Adam Sandler Movie That Has Grossed Over $100 Million At The Box Office</a></span></p><p>Even so, that's not to say he didn't have any stipulations, going into the experience.</p><p>So, just what were his demands?</p><h2 id=he-demanded-to-fight-and-beat-sandler-himself>He Demanded To Fight (And Beat) Sandler, Himself</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/adam-sandler-and-bob-barker-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>'s Golfweek, Bob Barker signed on to Happy Gilmore on the proviso of two non-negotiables. First, he would need to not just fight, but beat Sandler's character. Second - and this is where things get interesting - he needed assurance that he would be able to perform the fight, himself. No mean feat, given the tumbles he took during the iconic scene!</p><p>Unbeknownst to Sandler at the time, Barker lived right next door to one Chuck Norris. Yup, that Chuck Norris. And, as neighbors and friends, the two Hollywood legends had bonded over fight training, years prior. Understandably, the game show host was excited to show off what he'd learned from the iconic action star.</p><p>After agreeing to his stipulations, Barker was on board, and the film's legendary fight scene went off without a hitch. In fact, Chuck Norris is said to have continued training Barker right up until the night before the scene was filmed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's a good thing that Barker was down for the scene, because it was a memorable moment that had people buzzing after seeing it for the first time. It also gave way to the hilarious Sandler quote, Barker's show. The quote in question? "The price is wrong, b****!" Oh, and of course, Barker's final retort, after initially responding with a series of punches and a wild kick to the face. "Now you've had enough ... b****."</p><p>Unexpected, yet iconic. Shout out to Barker for being a sport, to Sandler for being willing to adapt the scene - and, of course, an honorable shout out to Chuck Norris!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmmaiaXZeus7fEq2San6KasqV506hkn6GXncGqusZmmJ2ZnWLAorrDpZyrZZmjeqmtz6mwZp%2BZobqwvsRo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fheres-why-bob-barker-agreed-to-fighting-adam-sandler-in-happy-gilmore.html&text=Here%27s%20Why%20Bob%20Barker%20Agreed%20To%20Fight%20Adam%20Sandler%20In%20%27Happy%20Gilmore%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-why-bob-barker-agreed-to-fighting-adam-sandler-in-happy-gilmore.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-bob-barker-agreed-to-fighting-adam-sandler-in-happy-gilmore.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Bob%20Barker%20Agreed%20To%20Fight%20Adam%20Sandler%20In%20%27Happy%20Gilmore%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fheres-why-bob-barker-agreed-to-fighting-adam-sandler-in-happy-gilmore.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Bob%20Barker%20Agreed%20To%20Fight%20Adam%20Sandler%20In%20%27Happy%20Gilmore%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-bob-barker-agreed-to-fighting-adam-sandler-in-happy-gilmore.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Bob%20Barker%20Agreed%20To%20Fight%20Adam%20Sandler%20In%20%27Happy%20Gilmore%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-why-bob-barker-agreed-to-fighting-adam-sandler-in-happy-gilmore.html&description=Here%27s%20Why%20Bob%20Barker%20Agreed%20To%20Fight%20Adam%20Sandler%20In%20%27Happy%20Gilmore%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mikey-madison-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-241338-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mikey Madison Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dan-schneider-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dan Schneider Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
